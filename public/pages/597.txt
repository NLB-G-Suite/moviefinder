user reviews &nbsp; this classic never loses its magic! romance, warmth &amp; humor! 13 may 2001 | by gmmax (peoria, illinois) &ndash; see all my reviews this sweet comedy never loses its appeal. claudette colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly, attractive newspaper reporter (clark gable). in the beginning, she treats him like a servant, but he never knuckles under to this behavior. the interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous. it is the classic portrayal of what may be called &quot;sexual tension.&quot; he takes care of her - does not take advantage of her - but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being, she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect. there is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike, and their &quot;breakfast&quot; is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find. as gable stands at the edge of the road and colbert is perched atop a wooden fence, his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character bugs bunny. this is a must-see for every one who loves old movies, and entertaining for all. 31 of 38 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
