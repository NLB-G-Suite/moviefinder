i didn&#39;t think so. and with such despicable characters, it is nearly impossible to find anyone, or anything, to laugh at. the most frustrating part about the film is that almod&oacute;var could have made this into a powerful drama, as he did with talk to her and bad education. all the elements are there, it&#39;s just in the completely wrong genre. it&#39;s like trying to turn schindler&#39;s list into a sitcom.but turning kika into a drama would involve a few changes, especially ver&oacute;nica forqu&eacute; as kika. she is completely over-the-top and not once convincing. she adds nothing to her part and is especially painful to watch during her emotionless and even smart alecky rape.the rape scene itself is the film&#39;s biggest red flag. no matter how hard you try, even if you are pedro almod&oacute;var, making comedy out of such an emotionally charged issue as rape will prove improbable if not impossible.with that said, kika is a blow to almod&oacute;var fans who find themselves defending his films as artistic not licentious. instead of an earnest film by a standout director, we are given an indecent soap opera with questionable direction. but we&#39;ll forgive you pedro, nobody&#39;s perfect. 12 of 22 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
