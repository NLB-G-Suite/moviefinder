edit did you know? trivia in the 1960s, the alice novels and their adaptations became associated with the counterculture movement and drug culture. the most notable reference to this association was the hit song "white rabbit" (1967) by jefferson airplane. it interpreted surreal moments from the novels as effects of sensory distortions experienced with hallucinogens. see more &raquo;

(it reminded me of the snooty elephants laughing and speaking with contempt of the new baby elephant in dumbo). other bits are equally brilliant--the shuffling army of cards in the queen of hearts episode; the baby oysters clothed in blue bonnets and pink dresses for the walrus and the carpenter; the droll humor in the tweedledum/tweedledee sequence; the smoking caterpillar becoming irate when his three inches of height becomes the subject of conversation; and of course, the mad tea party, full of hilarious slapstick and immensely aided by the voice talents of bill thompson (white rabbit), jerry colonna (march hare) and ed wynn (mad hatter). no less impressive is verna felton as the raucous voice of the queen of hearts in some of the film's funniest moments. with her army of cards, she plays a wicked game of croquet with flamingoes as mallets, hedgehog as a ball and cards as hoops, all the while displaying a lethal temper.despite some brilliant animation, pleasant songs and gorgeous art work, it's just another example of how difficult it is (&quot;impassable&quot; to quote carroll) to translate this particular tale to the screen and still remain faithful to the original. others (many other versions, in fact) have failed--but disney at least provides a sprightly, if frantic, version that has appeal for adults and children.perhaps because its surrealism matched the hippy culture of psychedelia, alice enjoyed a welcome theatrical return engagement in the '60s and has become more respected in recent years (an american-made british fantasy popular even in the u.k.) as one of the studio's finest efforts.ironically, one of its most delightful characters--the doorknob--never appeared in the book but was applauded everywhere as an inspired bit of business. 18 of 21 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 151 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: dee ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
