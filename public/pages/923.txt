rossellini, argo and soprano's ventimiglia are all good and del toro does yet another quiet cool role.overall this is a good film &#150; it is graphic and dark, but not as much as some of his other films. the subject matter will appeal to the mass audience (most people seem to like mobster movies) and his unromantic spin on the genre makes up for the occasionally bitty storyline. 8 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
