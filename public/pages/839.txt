edit storyline this adaptation of the raymond chandler novel 'farewell, my lovely', renamed for the american market to prevent filmgoers mistaking it for a musical (for which powell was already famous) has private eye philip marlowe hired by moose malloy, a petty crook just out of prison after a seven year stretch, to look for his former girlfriend, velma, who has not been seen for the last six years. the case is tougher than marlowe expected as his initially promising enquiries lead to a complex web of deceit involving bribery, perjury and theft, and where no one's motivation is obvious, least of all marlowe's. written by mark thompson &lt;mrt@oasis.icl.co.uk&gt;

'murder, my sweet' tones down some of the racial and sexual aspects of the original story (which are included in the 1970s remake), and i'm might be mistaken (it's been a while since i read it), but the anne shirley character appears to have been created as a potential love interest for dick powell. she seems to have been inspired by a similar character in 'double indemnity' (written by james m. cain and filmed the same year with the help of chandler). dick powell was originally a crooner and casting him as philip marlowe was a very strange choice at the time, but it certainly works. personally i would have preferred to see robert mitchum playing marlowe in this version, but by the 1970s he was too old for the part, and comparing the two versions powell definitely wins. claire trevor is also excellent as one of the definitive noir femme fatales, and her scenes with powell are compelling. the drug sequence is also very memorable. 'murder, my sweet' is one of the most entertaining detective thrillers ever made, and along with 'double indemnity' and 'out of the past' one of the very best crime movies of the 1940s. 35 of 39 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 109 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
