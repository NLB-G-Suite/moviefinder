see all my reviews this masterpiece, still makes me curious every time i see it. brad pitt does an amazing job portraying an austrian, even down to his accent. the cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. i love watching it every so often, and learning new things that i missed the times before.the film has a great amount of interesting facts, and takes place in the 1930&#39;s through &#39;50&#39;s. there are times when it is; magical, spiritual, enlightening, sweet, sad and poignant.i recommend it to anyone who enjoys interesting and true stories. if nothing else watch pitt with his masterful portrayal of this real life character, who faces hardships, physically, spiritually and emotionally. 37 of 49 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
