trivia tamra davis started as director of this film, with a script written by yolande turner and becky johnston. a few weeks into filming, the production company became unhappy with the direction the film was taking. they shut down production, replaced davis with jonathan kaplan, had the script rewritten and sent the four main actresses off to "cowboy camp" to learn how to shoot, rope and ride. see more &raquo; goofs in aqua dulce, the pinkertons say they are looking for a fugitive from colorado territory. colorado has been a state since 1876, approximately fifteen years before the setting of this film. see more &raquo; quotes anita: the population of the united states is over 63 million people now. lilly: they sure ain't here. see more &raquo; connections referenced in sideline secrets&nbsp;(2006) see more &raquo; soundtracks onward christian soldiers music by arthur sullivan lyrics by sabine baring-gould performed by the great mother lode brass and reed band see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what are the differences between the theatrical version and the extended cut?

well the back story offers up the answer. film was meant to be directed by a woman, tamra davis (erm-billy madison &#x26; crossroads), but she was jettisoned a couple of weeks into production. the plan with davis at the helm was for it to be a western told from a female point of view. however, kaplan (the accused/unlawful entry) was brought in quickly and the screenplay rewritten in a hurry. and boy does it show. technically it&#x27;s a duffer too, jerry goldsmith&#x27;s score is cheap in texture and jane kurson&#x27;s editing is choppy to say the least. there&#x27;s no eye catching cinematography (ralf d. bode), while the acting away from the script hindered girls (ie: the men), is either a waste of time them being in it (nick chinlund) or badly directed (james russo). while dermot mulroney seems only to exist as being a link to young guns; the &#x22;boy&#x22; version that this is clearly trying to ride the coat tails in on. if you want a good western about the girls fighting the good fight then seek out george marshall&#x27;s 1957 film the guns of fort petticoat. it&#x27;s a fun movie that at least has believable women fighting back under duress. bad girls, tho, is just bad in every department. 2/10 10 of 17 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
