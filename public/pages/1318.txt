user reviews what a fantastic film.... 8 february 1999 | by gambit-9 (bangor, wales, united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews as someone who lives only some 10 miles away, and known the story so well, it was such a pleasure to watch the film.it showed how pointless war is. i think that what ellis did, go and join up, so to save his younger brother from doing so, is so brave. such acts you wouldn't expect to see today in society.i have seen this film many times and it's just as good each time around. it will make any person cry at the end.one interesting thing, in the film huw garmon (ellis evans) courts sue rodderick (lizzie robers), but in a soap shown here in wales, sue plays huw's his mother!!! 6 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
