glorious motion picture; exciting, thrilling, and safe for the entire family! 3 june 2005 | by twisterchaser3 &ndash; see all my reviews i absolutely adore free willy. it ranks well above any movie about whales or dolphins, even flipper. free willy provides an exciting story about a troubled boy who befriends an orca whose situation is much like his own. and of course, we all love the star of the show, keiko! keiko had a life filled with traveling from one theme park to the other, and in a lot of ways he experienced much more that willy did. keiko played the part of the whale terrifically! james did a great job too acting as jesse, and gave the perfect image of a young boy who has lived on the streets. some people call it the best friendship movie since et. this movie rocks over et!, and shows us the true meaning of friendship. we all should learn that caring for another person or animal goes a long way. 14 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
