edit storyline this movie features the collaborative directorial efforts of four new filmmakers, each of whom directs a segment of this comedy. it's new year's eve at the mon signor hotel, a former grand old hollywood hotel, now fallen upon hard times. often using physical comedy and sight gags, this movie chronicles the slapstick misadventures of ted, the bellhop. he's on his first night on the job, when he's asked to help out a coven of witches in the honeymoon suite. things only get worse when he delivers ice to the wrong room and ends up in a domestic argument at a really bad time. next, he foolishly agrees to watch a gangster's kids for him while he's away. finally, he finishes off the night refereeing a ghastly wager. written by tad dibbern &lt;dibbern_d@a1.mscf.upenn.edu&gt;

edit did you know? trivia the reason bruce willis is not credited is because he violated sag rules for acting in this film for no money. he appeared for fun and as a favor to quentin tarantino, and acting for free violated sag rules. sag agreed not to sue willis if his name was not included in the credits. see more &raquo;

so damn funny 26 july 2003 | by quakenul (herne, germany) &ndash; see all my reviews i really don't understand why this film hasn't got a better rating. i mean, it's got everything: women, cars, weapons, alcohol and tarantino. it's just style itsself which made this film. seriously, tim roth is so damn good in this film, his acting, his expressions and his behavior, all is perfect. you can have a good laugh about without even following the storyline (which is worth doing that, but anyway). the film is profound and the and the different parts of it are linked. great film. 42 of 71 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
