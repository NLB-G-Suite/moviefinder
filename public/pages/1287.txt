progressive for it&#39;s time 22 april 2006 | by jay (new york, ny usa) &ndash; see all my reviews i stumbled across this film from netflix. i really had no preconceived notions of the film when i got the dvd in the mail. i was surprised and uplifted to see a film that was extremely progressive for being filmed in 1973(!) the discussions and concepts brought to light are somewhat the same as now. there was an openness to the cast and real people interviewed during the film that i was unaware of during the early 70s. so many times gay films seem to lack real substance and can&#39;t get over the basic premise of dealing with being gay and using stereotypical characters. the story moves from beyond that point and deals with real issues, even if it&#39;s just finding someone to love. i was very impressed and it was a great story of modern gay relationships. 11 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
