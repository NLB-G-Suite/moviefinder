see all my reviews being a huge fan of tarantinos earlier efforts reservoir dogs and pulp fiction expectations were of course high. especially since jackie brown is based on the elmore leonard novel &quot;rum punch&quot;. and elmore leonards stories usually fit the big screen very well, they are actually one of the rare occasions where i usually prefer the film to the novel.tarantino sets a different mood here compared to the more frantic and violent reservoir dogs and pulp fiction. this is more of a slow crime story that focuses more on being cool than being shocking. i think this movie works very well despite the slow pace which seems to put a lot of people off. mainly i think it works because the actors are all giving it their best (the casting is also excellent) while tarantino seems to handle the whole story more gently than in pulp fiction. he doesn't stress it, he doesn't run the risk of over-doing the &quot;cool&quot; parts. the end result is enjoyable but a lot more somber than what you're used to from tarantino.all in all i feel this movie is underrated. it's enjoyable, well made and stylish. recommended to those not demanding all movies to head on at breakneck speed. i rate it 7/10. 77 of 94 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
