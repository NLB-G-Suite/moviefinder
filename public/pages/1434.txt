see all my reviews this is the film which i cherish above all others and one which i will never forget.a look into the lives of the destitute people in the street and in the the shelters made for them, particularly the fort washington shelter for men.the story is told through the eyes of its principle narrator jerry (danny glover). the story is about matthew (matt dillon), a young schizophrenic, who finds himself evicted when his apartment building is torn down. he tries to ask for his welfare money but is told to go elsewhere to a non-existent address. he eventually ends up outside the the fort washington shelter for men, where he first encounters jerry. he attempts to take a photo of jerry with his camera, which offends jerry. matthew however tells jerry that the camera is empty and that his hobby is photography. jerry begins to take an interest in matthew.he is threatened in the bathroom by little leroy, a much feared thug, who preys upon the weaker members of the fort washington shelter for men. but however he is timely rescued by jerry who breaks leroy&#x27;s arm in the process. leroy swears his vengeance against both jerry and matthew.jerry, a streetwise combat veteran, takes matthew under his wing. the relationship between these two men grows as they attempt to conquer the numbing isolation of homelessness.jerry earns some money by cleaning the windows of cars as the pass through a busy part of the street. he teaches matthew this profession, whop speedily masters it. matthew soon begins to save up some money. jerry buys matthew some film so that he can start taking some photos.jerry tells matthew more about his personal life. he advises mathew that to escape from the shelters they have only to save enough money to rent an apartment and so escape the fort washington shelter. he also tells matthew about his dream of selling fruits and vegetables from the back of a car to make fast and easy money. the two men now begin to have a goal in life: to rent an apartment and start a business for themselves. will they achieve their dreams? it is up to you to watch the film and see what happens next.an outstanding performance by both danny glover and matt dillon and both are deserving of an oscar. as well as an oscar for the director tim hunter. ving rhames is also brilliant in his role as little leroy. the cinematography is good showing the busy city life and the packed fort washington shelter.overall 10/10. a film you will remember of the rest of your life. 10 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
