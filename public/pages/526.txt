as evidenced in the maltese falcon and treasure of the sierra madre, huston can take what might wind up a plot and transform it into a story. he understands that characters - human, conflicted, devious characters - are essential to creating genre pictures that transcend their genre. without huston, this film would have undoubtedly faltered; his steady and determined hand guides this film from the hazards of superficiality without sacrificing entertainment and adventure.he does not create a great film single-handedly though, as connery and caine, who both give tremendous performances, bestow upon peachy and daniel immense likability despite their scoundrel airs. caine proves again why he may be the greatest living british actor and connery reminds us that there's more to him than 007.as i said, this is one of the greatest adventure tales brought to the screen. though some may disagree, in particular my friend who threw the dvd at my head, it's better than any of the late 30s swashbucklers and better than most shoot-em-ups made since. 46 of 63 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
