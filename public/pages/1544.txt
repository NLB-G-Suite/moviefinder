the interviews and perspective are in large part on lewie anderson, who probably has the most common sense as we can see it (or rather in comparison with the consultant ray rogers, who is technically a corporate guy as well), and how he has to approach the union and the chief committee about where to go with hormel - and of course the flaws are there, like rewriting the contract that has forty years of bargaining in it for the rights of the workers. this is not to say that, for the warts-and-all approach kopple takes, that she is on the side of the corporate masters at hormel. we see one of their spokesman, who is a down-the-line party guy, talk to the camera(s) with the candor that one expects from such a corporate man about dealing with the union leaders (maybe not as villainous as, say, a roger smith from roger &#x26; me, but what is). but it&#x27;s mostly there, in those halls and on the picket lines and in those smokey, emotional offices that kopple takes her sights and tells this story. how it becomes a tale for almost everyone (not to say that, probably, those who have worked in unions or know people who have, that makes up a good lot of americans, will connect deeper with it) is that it&#x27;s not about complex legal wrangling. it&#x27;s about what people do when pushed up against a wall, and put themselves into a war.it is a complicated tale to tell, that is without easy answers, but by the end you can&#x27;t say you don&#x27;t see how things did not turn out well, especially with the greater picture (albeit not shown really or at least on the level of the &#x27;smaller-but-bigger&#x27; picture the director paints) that the country was in at the time, and still are. what happens to these americans, all hard workers, when faced against corporate pressures, and then other workers are brought in across the picket lines. what happens to society?
