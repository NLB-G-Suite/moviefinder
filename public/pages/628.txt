user reviews &nbsp; a snake, a brain, a cabbie, a duke and the president of the usa, 16 october 2008 | by spikeopath (united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews it&#39;s 1997 and manhattan island is a walled off prison, during the flight of air force one, the president&#39;s plane is taken over by a terrorist and the president ejects out in the safety pod. sadly for him he lands right in the middle of manhattan island, when an armed unit lands inside the walls they are told that the president has been taken hostage and they must get out of their prison asap. at a loss what to do, the authorities decide to send one man in alone, ex war hero turned criminal, snake plissken, not only does he have to contend with surviving the incredibly hostile prison, he also has a time bomb implanted in his body that, should he not get the president out safely within 24 hours, will explode and mean no more snake plissken!.made in 1981 and set in 1997, it&#39;s safe to say john carpenter is not the best predictor of the future around. however his vision of a future where america has thrown all it&#39;s criminals on one island, where they create their own society out of harms way, has to rank as an incredibly adroit piece of work. this place is grim and deadly, the flotsam and jetsam of society thrust together in this bleak and desolate place of class separation. what carpenter has achieved with his usual minimal budget allowance is a smouldering sci-fi classic that may be as daft as they come, but it pulses with cool and cheekily slaps you round the face with its cheeky satirical edginess. i must give kudos at this point to the great production design from joe alves, who along with carpenter has crafted this brilliantly dirty netherworld of crime.our anti-hero of the piece, snake plissken, is superbly played by kurt russell, the original choice interestingly was tommy lee jones, but russell fuels plissken&#39;s mantra to make him one of the eighties coolest grumpy bastards!, and his work here is first class in terms of the films apocalyptic structure. surroundning russell is a wealth of quality performers each adding their personal bits to this tick-tock stew, lee van cleef, ernest borgnine, donald pleasance, harry dean stanton, adrienne barbeau and isaac hayes all earn their money and flesh out the story to the end.calling escape from new york an action picture would be setting first time viewers up for a real let down, what action there is is minimal but highly effective, the machismo flourishes acting more as a point of reference to the pictures time bomb urgency. i like to think of the film as more a sci-fi adventure yarn laced with darkly comic humour, with of course machismo thrown in as a side salad to accentuate the bleakness of it all, wonderful. 9/10 32 of 40 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
