many more, are hilarious. arnold is stiff as usual, but he's able to show a convincing transformation. they almost make the premise believable. bono's rendition of &quot;got you under my skin&quot; at the closing credits is my only fault with the movie. 13 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
