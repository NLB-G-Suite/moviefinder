john woo and van damme make a pretty good team 19 april 2000 | by johnnyphreak (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews right here and now i'll say this is van damme best movie and he picked the right director for it. it an action adventure about a team of killers are who paid to hunt by rich people. the movie is not action filled as the video box may tell you. but it does have enough to make your mouth water. if you know john woo than you know that his films spread out the action and put space of acting between them. the acting is not top notch but it is believable. but what makes this movie is the action sequences. they have remnants of woo's other movies like broken arrow, hard boiled, the killer and the final scene looks like it was plucked straight out of face/off. you have to see it to believe it. van damme does his normal tough guy not talking much thing but it is great to see him with two pistols in his hands. it's a 7 for total movie but gets a 10 for action. action movie junkies will love hard target. john woo and van damme makes for great action. 19 of 24 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
