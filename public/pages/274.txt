great acting, mediocre movie 7 may 1999 | by george carr (georgecarr@gmail.com) (cleveland, ohio) &ndash; see all my reviews i enjoyed this film, but only for two specific things: the acting of masterson and slater. masterson is startlingly good, and slater shows a deeper range than i previously thought. the rest of the film, though, is shallow and never fully realized. plot elements are thin and almost unbelievable, several of the supporting actors are terrible, the music is trite and unoriginal, the cinematography is downright boring, and the dialogue falls into inanity and predictability too often. if not for the heroic performances of the lead couple, this film would be entirely forgettable. masterson, though, is truly gifted, and digs deep to find the center of her character, and slater reaches a bit himself for a romantic side i've never seen. i give it a 6, for the acting alone. 10 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
