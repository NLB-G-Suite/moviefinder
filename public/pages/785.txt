frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; uneven joint 20 may 2007 | by olliez (wolves, england) &ndash; see all my reviews although i wouldn&#39;t say this is a great lee film, it is still very solid. there isn&#39;t a story as such, instead it is a love letter to childhood and family life in brooklyn. imagine radio days, including the sentimental streak.the actors are great and this movie only goes to prove that delroy lindo is one of the best actors around. zelda harris as the young girl, troy, is also brilliant. alfre woodard is the pivot of the film, around which most of the film revolves around - even if she has less than troy.tonally the film doesn&#39;t quite click. sometimes the original music is quite sour and does not fit with the images. some scenes seem forced.but the amazing soundtrack helps put things right.even though the film isn&#39;t perfect, it has a great soundtrack and a very unique take on things. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
