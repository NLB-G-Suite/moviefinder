successful multi genre 26 february 2007 | by tom-2128 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie is a comedy, drama, romance, sports movie, and a money movie (e.g. wall street, where the main character is trying to make a lot of money). the problem such a movie faces is maintaining a consistent tone. remember prizzi&#39;s honor? jm solves that problem by using restraint. it doesn&#39;t go over the top, although its characters sometimes do. it has funny moments, but it&#39;s not animal house or american pie. it&#39;s a drama, but it keeps the stakes low. this isn&#39;t armageddon: they aren&#39;t trying to save the world. there are no life or death decisions. the romantic stakes aren&#39;t that high either: renee zellweger loves tom cruise, but she&#39;s been in love before and if this doesn&#39;t work out, she will be again. the only really high stakes are the money. by keeping the stakes low, jm let&#39;s us watch it with a bit of detachment.this is more of a drama than a comedy. a good test is whether the characters change. here, tom cruise starts off completely cynical, abruptly changes to ridiculously idealistic, then spends the rest of the movie finding the right balance. renee zellweger starts by loving tom cruise from afar, then gets him, then has to work out her ambiguous feelings.jm is fun to watch. the characters, though flawed, are sympathetic. we enjoy watching them succeed, fail (sometimes in funny ways), and try to discover what they really care about. it&#39;s complicated, thoughtful, and surprisingly subtle. 39 of 49 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
