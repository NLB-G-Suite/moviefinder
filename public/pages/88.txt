edit storyline in the futuristic year of 2019, los angeles has become a dark and depressing metropolis, filled with urban decay. rick deckard, an ex-cop, is a "blade runner". blade runners are people assigned to assassinate "replicants". the replicants are androids that look like real human beings. when four replicants commit a bloody mutiny on the off world colony, deckard is called out of retirement to track down the androids. as he tracks the replicants, eliminating them one by one, he soon comes across another replicant, rachel, who evokes human emotion, despite the fact that she's a replicant herself. as deckard closes in on the leader of the replicant group, his true hatred toward artificial intelligence makes him question his own identity in this future world, including what's human and what's not human. written by blazesnakes9 plot summary | plot synopsis plot keywords: tech noir | human android relationship | police detective | artificial intelligence | female android |&nbsp;see all (242)&nbsp;&raquo;

user reviews finest hour. 12 december 2004 | by russellebell (essex england) &ndash; see all my reviews this is simply scott's finest hour. there are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with clich&eacute; upon clich&eacute; and often miss the whole point. what ridley scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. it really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by phillip k dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven't quite made the grade for the off world colonies. we have a true smelting pot of nationalities.the heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.this film also sees ford in perfect casting.theirs a rye charm that ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. for me,the directors cut is simply too cut. i preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. the finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. no other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. it captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. from the chase scene with zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot. this is my favourite movie of all time for all the reasons above and many more i could effortlessly type all day and night. 218 of 323 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
