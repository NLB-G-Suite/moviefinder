edit storyline may-alice culhane was a successful soap opera star, but a car accident has left her bound to a wheelchair. she returns to her now-empty family home in the bayous of louisiana which she had eagerly left years before. she drinks heavily and vents her bitterness on the succession of nurses who are hired to take care of her and immediately quit because she is so unbearable. chantelle is the latest of these nurses, and may-alice is told that chantelle is the last nurse she'll get. chantelle for reasons of her own, is also in a position where she badly needs the job to work out. the movie focuses on how these two women become friends and help each other heal emotionally. written by reid gagle plot summary | plot synopsis plot keywords: louisiana | accident | actress | soap opera | wheelchair |&nbsp;see all (18)&nbsp;&raquo;

see it again! 26 october 1999 | by yama-2 (baltimore, md) &ndash; see all my reviews i love this movie as much today as i did when i first viewed it. the performances by the actors were wonderful, the soundtrack is really fantastic, and john sayles' script was funny and thought provoking. i loved the whole may alice-rennie angle, the may alice-chantelle, and the chantelle-sugar story lines, all woven together masterfully. one of the things i love best about john sayles' movies is his ability to add supporting characters in such a fun and useful way. and he chooses real actors for those parts (note angela bassett). i thought he really captured the feel of bayou land, la. and friction? boy! was there ever friction! 9 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
