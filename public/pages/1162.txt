see all my reviews chevy chase is terrific in 70&#x27; &#x26; 80&#x27; but loose quickly your hand in comedy like that,a little unfunny jokes here a gag there...anyway isn&#x27;t the same. this a kind moralistic comedy co-starring the beauty farrah fawcett that lost your touch too,so this kind of disney movie don&#x27;t add nothing to the careers of those great actors.....unfortunately!! 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
