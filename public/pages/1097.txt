edit storyline al stump is a famous sports-writer chosen by ty cobb to co-write his official, authorized 'autobiography' before his death. cobb, widely feared and despised, feels misunderstood and wants to set the record straight about 'the greatest ball-player ever,' in his words. however, when stump spends time with cobb, interviewing him and beginning to write, he realizes that the general public opinion is largely correct. in stump's presence, cobb is angry, violent, racist, misogynistic, and incorrigibly abusive to everyone around him. torn between printing the truth by plumbing the depths of cobb's dark soul and grim childhood, and succumbing to cobb's pressure for a whitewash of his character and a simple baseball tale of his greatness, stump writes two different books. one book is for cobb, the other for the public. written by tad dibbern &lt;dibbern_d@a1.mscf.upenn.edu&gt;

see all my reviews under-rated and under-seen at the time of its original release, cobb is the kind of sports film that would be un-watchable if it weren't made with such care to the dramatic side of things. ron shelton, responsible for such films as bull durham and play it to the bone, takes the story of finding a story as the basis for this tale of the legend ty cobb. stump (roberto wuhl, pre-arliss) takes on the task of writing a biography of one of the most notorious players of baseball, and when he meets him and starts to know him, he's almost scared to death. we learn from cobb himself (in tommy lee jones' equivalent to robert de niro in raging bull) about his early years, his personal life to a degree (some of this is in detail, some of it's just in creative little snippets later on in the film), but not a whole lot about baseball. but what is known practically sums up the man- he felt a thrill in torturing the offensive team and getting jeered as he broke records (some of which may still stand today). as the story progresses, the relationship between stump and cobb is what becomes the focal point, and it's a tense, depressing, and oddly exciting path.the details in the story, not of the flattering sort by any measure, give the film an appeal that would've been lost if it were one of those straight-to-tv movies where you'd only get hints of the man's nature. by way of the writer getting a story, shelton brings revelatory points that are rather interesting, of occasionally off-putting. it's hard to imagine what it would be like to ride with cobb, but watching it this way brings on a visceral reaction, at least from me. i first saw this film when i was younger when it was first on hbo, and i saw it again recently. as a case in psychology, it's a good movie. as a portrait of disintegration it's even better. but if you're thinking of getting a news-reel portraying only his accomplishments, look elsewhere. i'm not sure if ty cobb was a great baseball player, but the film doesn't spare him at least some praise in that area. that jones steals the show is no surprise either. a- 4 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
