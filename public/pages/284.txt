trivia the film was released in december, five days before christmas. the studio did this because during the holiday season, family friendly movies are usually released, and the studio wanted to give the horror audience something to see during a time when no horror movies would be out. it opened at #4 with 6.4 million, which led the studio to believe the film had flopped. however, the film's good word of mouth is what led to its success at the box office. with every week it went up or stayed at the same place in the box office. by the end of its run, it ended up making over 100 million at the united states box office. see more &raquo; goofs (at around 55 mins) when stu scares randy in the video store he drops a video case which is obviously empty. however, in order to prevent theft, most video stores displayed empty cases to the public. when a customer wanted to rent a video they would take the empty case to an employee who would then retrieve the tape for them. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] casey: hello?
