happiness is from within where all true wealth is, its reification into material goods will only be like drinking sea water; it makes you thirstier. lose and laugh, my friends, for the last laugh is on all of us. we too blow away in the wind, love and goodness are all we can ever take with us. they are meant to be given to all we meet. my favorite movie&#x22;he who possesses is himself possessed.&#x22; nietzsche&#x22;all that is not given is lost.&#x22; a hindu saying 53 of 79 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
