user reviews &nbsp; great fun - don't expect anything else 12 january 2000 | by anders &aring;slund (anders.aslund@xpress.se) (karlstad, sweden) &ndash; see all my reviews why should one watch this film? it's stupid, without any character developments and is about as believable as any james bond movie. i'll tell you: it's great fun. when i watch a movie, i try not to confuse art with entertainment, as some commenters clearly have done. true lies doesn't have a hint of art - but its comic-style spirit and adventurous action is compelling. and please don't be childish - admit you like seeing nukes go off on screen. this film isn't a great film. but it is great fun. 67 of 100 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
