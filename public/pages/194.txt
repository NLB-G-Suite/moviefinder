trivia ava gardner sought the role of mrs. robinson, and reportedly called mike nichols saying,"i want to see you! i want to talk about this graduate thing!" nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as bancroft was 36 and gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. he later recounted that "she sat at a little french desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star cliché. she said, 'all right, let's talk about your movie. first of all, i strip for nobody.'" see more &raquo; goofs in the first scene at the airport, ben walks close towards the automatic door, past a pillar. in the next shot, he hasn't reached the pillar, and walks for a few second to reach where he was where the cut occurred. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] pilot: ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our descent into los angeles. the sound you just heard is the landing gear locking into place. los angeles weather is clear; temperature is 72. we expect to make our 4 hour and 18 minute flight on schedule. we have enjoyed having you on board, and look forward to seeing you again in the near future. see more &raquo; connections referenced in orange county&nbsp;(2002) see more &raquo; soundtracks wedding march (1843) (uncredited) from &quot;a midsummer night's dream&quot; written by felix mendelssohn-bartholdy played on piano at the wedding see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how much sex, violence, and profanity are in this movie?
