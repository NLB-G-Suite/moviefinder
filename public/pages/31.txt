edit storyline this movie chronicles the life and times of r. crumb. robert crumb is the cartoonist/artist who drew keep on truckin', fritz the cat, and played a major pioneering role in the genesis of underground comix. through interviews with his mother, two brothers, wife, and ex-girlfriends, as well as selections from his vast quantity of graphic art, we are treated to a darkly comic ride through one man's subconscious mind. as stream-of-consciousness images incessantly flow forth from the tip of his pen, biting social satire is revealed, often along with a disturbing and haunting vision of crumb's own betes noires and inadequacies. as his acid-trip induced images flicker across our own retinas, we gain a little insight into this complex and highly creative individual. written by tad dibbern &lt;dibbern_d@a1.mscf.upenn.edu&gt;

somebody gave me an enema..... 24 may 2001 | by wbhickok (wbhickok@hotmail.com) (sd ca) &ndash; see all my reviews 'crumb' is a fascinating, unsettling, but equally hilarious look at robert crumb. even people who have no artistic talent or interest in the arts would be impressed with this movie. watching how this man endured a brutal childhood and how he tried to escape it all. his candid remarks are a riot. the interview with dian hanson was hilarious, [does anybody have a copy of that issue]. the segments with his brothers were funny but sad at the same time. there were only two items i wish they would have included, i would have liked to seen him talk about his tax problems, and second, i wish he would have played a number with band he is in. 18 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
