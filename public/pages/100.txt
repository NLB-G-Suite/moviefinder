see all my reviews i have to admit, i loved this movie from when i first saw it. a true cult classic, and second in midnight movie viewing only to rocky horror.i think one reason that this movie was looked forward to for so long is that it was unavailable for so long. i remember around 1984 when a release was planned, and a dispute with the multiple musicians caused it to be pulled. but thankfully this was finally resolved, so we can own it again.i bought a pirate copy when i was in japan in 1988 (on beta no less), and almost played it to death. and having been a fan of the comic when i could find it, i think it told the stories very well. i admit that the &quot;green sphere&quot; link was silly and did not work, and that the original &quot;carousel&quot; concept would have been much better (watch the dvd release for details on this). the simple fact that i have bought 3 copies of this time and still own all 3 of them says something about the movie.harry canyon, den, and taarna are the be the most remembered pieces of this movie. each in itself could even be fleshed out to hour long length, and still be enjoyable. so beautiful, so dangerous is enjoyable, and harold ramis and john candy steal the show with their voices (&quot;hey man, you got any of that plutonium niborg left?&quot;). and i admit, the film version of the story was much more enjoyable then the original one from the comic.ps: watch for the cameo of a destroyed uss enterprise. i love pointing that out to people that miss it. 37 of 45 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
