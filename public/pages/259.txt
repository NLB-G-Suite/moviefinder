wrong. it's has no reference to christopher reeve's man of steel stories, so it sucks.this &quot;comic book&quot; movie stars the miami heat's shaq as john henry irons, a technical/scientific genius (*snicker*) who creates the super armor just to beat lame bad guy judd nelson! in doing this, &quot;steel&quot; becomes one big joke. it's 100% obvious how shaq was miscast, and once he dons the &quot;armor&quot;, looks like he poured glue all over his body and fell into fred sanford's junkyard. peppered with unnecessary inside jokes about shaq's crappy free throwing, this movie has no value to comic readers or movie lovers. action scenes had potential, but fell flat with neither creativity or fun. bad bad bad. better casting, better written story, better special fx and a tie to superman would have ensured a blockbuster, but now it's just cannon fodder for comic book fans.to see the true steel in motion, look to the 90s superman cartoon, he looks like the character and is voiced by michael dorn( st: tng). you'll be happier watching that than this movie. 13 of 18 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
