quotes [rick and melissa endeavour to have a totally honest conversation for 2 1/2 minutes] melissa: why do men lie? rick: uh, that's a hard one. give me something frivolous to get into it. melissa: ok. why do men touch their dick so much? rick: because it's there. see more &raquo;

on pufnstuf willy-wonka sets and in some scenes the ritz but, oh, it keeps becoming some sort of dinner theater farce in some over produced sets with &#x22;actors!!!&#x22; who are &#x22;acting...!!!&#x22; what might have seemed funny 20 years ago in this multiplex wannabee is not funny now when better slicker films are the norm. hotel de love is a cute idea with some money behind it, and very good looking young actors, but it lurches into amateur constantly, one dreadful downside of the writer also being the director and the enterprise needing a strong no nonsense helm. a re make in 2020 might be a better vision. literally. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
