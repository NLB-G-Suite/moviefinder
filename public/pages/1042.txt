see all my reviews poor ellen. she's finally getting some respect in hollywood with excellent performances in such films as edtv, the love letter, etc, yet has to deal with having starred in this flop.talent such as herself, bill pullman, joan cusack, dean stockwell, ellen cleghorne, and the sensational joan plowright is wasted in this turkey.i must admit however that it did start off promising - the typical single woman living in the shadow of recently married sister, meets nice guy, blah blah blah.. but went totally downhill soon afterwards. what caused whitman (pullman) to be such a hyperactive fool? and joan cusack and her feeb slave bob? i love joan, she's had some great roles (hence the 2 oscar noms) but not even her charismatic prowess can save this hairball. she has to deal with a brainless character who cuts couches and puts gum in ellen's hair! sheesh - and the mexican kids?? well, i laughed at that scene.. i found it to be quite racist also mind you.unfunny, unoriginal and uninspired right up to the end wedding where ellen is in rollerblades or something and joan is sporting a rifle. spare me the hyperbole and give me my ninety minutes back.2.5/10 10 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
