frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews a dolphin can be a great friend after all. 24 june 2006 | by emasterslake (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this is a spin off of the tv series flipper. but i don&#39;t remember much about the tv series so i don&#39;t know the difference from one another.this is about an average boy teenager named sandy. who is spending the week with his uncle which he&#39;s unaware on what he&#39;s like.sandy isn&#39;t too excited in seeing him because he really wanted to go to a red hot chilly peppers concert.his uncle is porter an austrailian/american seaman who enjoys fishing for a living. and lives in a rigidly old hut that might not look to satisfying to guests.sandy finds it unbelievable that he&#39;s related to this guy. things seem boring till he encounters a dolphin who is very playful. sandy finds a new friend to be with through out his vacation.this movie isn&#39;t too bad. cool thing is it had ejiah woods as sandy and paul hogan as porter. i recommend it for 8 and up. rent it first before buying it. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
