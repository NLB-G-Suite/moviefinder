i really enjoyed this movie! 24 august 2005 | by eighthsense (california) &ndash; see all my reviews i liked the fact that the actors portrayed real people and looked like real people. i enjoyed very much seeing lorraine devon sing &quot;i surrender&quot;-the only thing that would have topped her incredible performance would have been if j.d. souther (david)had sung. this was the first time i saw j.d. as an actor, and i loved him-he's so understated yet intense and &quot;present&quot;, just like he is in his music video &quot;go ahead and rain&quot;. the story line and the message (no need to be looking at the destination-enjoy the journey there) were very intelligently woven. this movie proved that &quot;chick flick&quot; does not mean &quot;silly'. 1 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 2 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo;
