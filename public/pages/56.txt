i had no problem with it; i'd go out and drink the wine. i suppose there's a little of the martyr in all of us. see more &raquo; connections featured in siskel &amp; ebert &amp; the movies: rob roy/tommy boy/jefferson in paris/bulletproof heart/priest&nbsp;(1995) see more &raquo; soundtracks you'll never walk alone written by richard rodgers &amp; oscar hammerstein ii published by williamson music see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; moving and powerful 13 june 2006 | by preppy-3 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews a young handsome catholic priest father greg (linus roache) starts at a new parish in london. he butts heads with the older and more lenient father matthew (tom wilkinson) but they become friends. but greg is gay and sneaks out to gay bars to meet men. he meets up with graham (robert carlyle) and they fall in love--but greg feels guilty about it. also a young girl tells him in confession that her father is sexually using her--but he can&#x27;t tell anybody. slowly these two issues start to drive him crazy...excellent drama. this was attacked by the catholic church (who didn&#x27;t see it) as being anti-catholic. director antonia bird said she wasn&#x27;t trying to blast the catholic church--and she doesn&#x27;t! she&#x27;s pointing out some issues that the catholic church has and should be dealt with. the church is not demonized--they show the good and the bad. the film is well-written--i never thought theological discussions could be interesting but they are! also they don&#x27;t pull back--there is some extreme anti-gay language but it is needed for the story. the sex scenes between carlyle and roache are pretty tame though--especially in the american version where they&#x27;re edited (stupid censors!).the acting is superb. carlyle is just excellent: wilkinson was also good but roache is just incredible. you see the pain in his face and feel his struggle trying to reconcile his faith with his orientation. the most powerful sequence comes when he breaks down in front of a cross begging god to help him.i don&#x27;t want to make it sound like this is all gloom and doom. there are some very funny moments mixed in too. the ending is sad but realistic (unfortunately). a powerful and moving film. a must-see. 10 all the way. 16 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
