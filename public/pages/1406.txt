excellent movie, i own the rottweiler puppy, lyric that was in this movie 24 june 2006 | by vtlric (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i was very surprised at how good this movie was. my rottweiler, lyric, who is now 13 years old was in this movie when she was 7 weeks old. i named her lyric after the role of jada pinkett. lyric went on to be an american/canadian champion. her show name is am/ca ch. von traeger&#39;s lyric. the movie took place in the 3rd ward in houston, texas. it was awesome being on the set during the filming of this movie. i am looking at showing lyric at the &quot;reliant center world dog show&quot; in houston this next month. she will be shown in veterens class 12 years and older. this is a rottweiler specialty show. thank you for letting me share. kerri 4 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
