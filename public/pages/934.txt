trivia according to penny marshall's memoir "my mother was nuts", the part of sergeant cass was originally offered to ving rhames. he turned it down as a friend had written a part for him specifically in another movie, pulp fiction. when he turned the roll down, it was offered to gregory hines. penny marshall's only concern was the gregory hines was too nice. even when he was yelling at the troops he came off as nice. see more &raquo; goofs during the awards ceremony, a close up of pvt. davis shows him in formation with other graduates to his left. yet, when colonel james walks up to pvt. davis to present him with his father's &quot;silver&quot; star, pvt. davis is standing at the end of the row of graduates with no one to his left (colonel james approaches him on his left side). see more &raquo; quotes bill rago: excuse me. excuse me. i'm looking for the army education center.
