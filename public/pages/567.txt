see all my reviews acceptable sci-fi picture which achieved a moderated success on its appearance and dealing with a teenage girl and her father discover alien clones are replacing humans on a remote u.s. military base in alabama . this is a passable rendition starred by a good cast such as forest whitaker , meg tilly, terry kinney and gabriella anwar . it is an average budget version , though sometimes slow-paced and including some jolts of horror . science fiction , military and fantasy is presented in its most horrifying form . a genuinely frightening , chilling exercise in nightmare dislocation in which hideous creatures from outer space arrive on earth with plans of conquest by means of pods and being freely based upon a novel by jack finney . there are not monsters only the residents of a military headquarter , as their wills , minds and bodies taken over by a weird form of life from outer space . this is the third adaptation , still very scary and creepy about a vintage novel deals with some military residents who are being replaced by duplicates hatched from weird pods . it creates an altering the human behaviour in the new invaders . as a doctor (terry kinney) must protect his daughter (significant role for gorgeous gabriella anwar) and her new stepmother (meg tilly), and soon aware that pods from outer space are duplicating and menacing everyone there . meantime , the teenager daughter befriends a handsome attack helicopter pilot, tim young (billy wirth) and a young girl named jenn platt (christine elise) , daughter of headquarter commander (lee ermey). the doctor may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion as he discovers their friends are being taking over by cold human-duplicates , as one by one are turned into aliens . while examining specimen, doctor malone is approached by angst-ridden major collins (forrest whitaker), who asks him about psychological effects particularly narcophobia . the mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread along military camp , everybody are being taken over by emotionless , cold behaving beings . the strange seeds from outer space are growing and destroying a little base at an alarming attack.this scary sci-fi displays a tense screenplay freely based on jack finney novel titled &#xa8;body snatchers&#xa8; that can be considered truly disturbing . packs eerie suspense , chills , thrills , spectacular scenes , chilly events and pretty turns and twists . a ceaselessly inventive , ghastly rendition of the alien take-over paradigm , including a a nice built-in paranoia about a small military base is infiltrated by pods from outer space that replace and replicate human beings . it profits from an intense acting by terry kenney , forrest whitaker , r. lee ermey along with an enjoyable gabrielle anwar ; furthermore , a right direction by abel ferrra who proved himself master of the eerie clutch at the base of one&#x27;s spine . appropriately exciting and frightening musical score by joe delia , though composed by means of synthesizer. atmospheric cinematography and evocatively eerie ambient by cameraman bazzeli , this was the first film shot with arriscope anamorphic lenses, which were created for arri by the german manufacturer isco-optic. adequate production design and considerable visual and special effects . the motion picture was professionally directed by abel ferrara . director ferrara brought an entirely new approach to the sci-fi field to a well known story that has been shot various times . he filmed an attractive tale and it has emerged as an acceptable sci-fi thriller that brings astonishing nightmares . lovers of the thriller/chiller should no miss this considerable sci-fi , everybody will have fun being scared by this expertly crafted film . other versions about this known story are the following : a post-mccarthy paranoid fantasy epic titled &#xa8;invasion of the body snatchers&#xa8; (1958), stunning and frightening adaptation which emerged as a cinema classic which achieved tremendous and unexpected success on its appearance , so well tuned for the times that some saw it a parable communist witch hunts ; being compellingly directed by donald siegel with kevin maccarthy , dana wynter , larry gates , carolyn jones , and sam peckinpah ; 1978 new version also titled &#xa8;invasion of the body snatchers&#xa8; , one of few instances where a remake is an improvement on the original , directed by philip kauffman with donald sutherland , brooke adams and features cameos by don siegel and kevin mccarthy from the original , realized with great originality in spite of being a remake concerning again about mysterious seeds duplicating people . lately recent version that results to be the least satisfactory and yet another inferior titled &#xa8;invasion&#xa8; with daniel craig, nicole kidman , jeffrey wright and directed by oliver hirschbiegel , this so-so take on , it takes advantage of the advances in fx , sound technology and some interesting visual effects . 8 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
