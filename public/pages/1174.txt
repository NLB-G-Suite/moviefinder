pathetic 5 june 1999 | by anonymous &ndash; see all my reviews i was duped into watching this movie by my roommate, and it was so awful it was painful to watch. this was an attempt at a self-created vehicle by the washed-up singer of the 80's hair band poison. the waste of film consists of a clich&eacute; plot which is incredibly scattered, and horrendous acting-even sub-par to usa up all night flicks! to add insult to injury you have to deal with bret michael's worthless songs throughout the movie. absolutely not worth anyone's time-even if you didn't pay for the rental. 6 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
