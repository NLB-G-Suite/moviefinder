the paper does deliver 26 november 2007 | by jefonline (canada) &ndash; see all my reviews kudos to my fellow canadian from manitoba who got it dead on! this is one of those movies that can should be played during college and university recruiting presentations. being a newspaper journalist myself, this one kept me up until 2 or 2 in the am on a sunday night. it was that good. the end of the movie makes it all worthwhile. i am surprised i had never heard of this movie until the day i saw it. mchael keaton, glenn close and randy quaid were excellent and this movie gives you a very good look at what it&#39;s like to be working in the newspaper business, with deadlines, dealing with superiors and the things you have to go through sometimes in order to get the job done. i guess it&#39;s a little late to be wondering about a sequel to this one but hopefully another director can take a stab at creating what this one just did. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
