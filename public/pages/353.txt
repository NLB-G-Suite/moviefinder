edit did you know? trivia many people incorrectly remember this film as being directed by stanley kubrick, who directed a clockwork orange (1971) (with a similar theme of criminal reformation therapy) and the shining (1980) (with a similar theme of jack nicholson's madness, and an appearance by scatman crothers). this film is often considered the best "non-kubrick kubrick film." see more &raquo; goofs towards the end of the movie, there are multiple references to it being winter, the most obvious are: the television announcer mentions the &quot;upcoming holiday season&quot;, and the morning after the party, a sign saying the date is december 11th can be briefly seen. however, in shots of the outside, there are leaves on the trees, birds outside, and other small details inconsistent with winter in oregon. see more &raquo;
