user reviews my favourite tagline for a movie 22 january 2005 | by walter frith (hamilton, ontario, canada) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;in space, no one can hear you scream.&quot; this remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. when 'alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'star wars' did when released two years earlier. the science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: a space odyssey' in 1968. definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. it is director ridley scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film. 154 of 191 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
