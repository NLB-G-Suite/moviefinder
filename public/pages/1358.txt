see all my reviews the most enchanting movie i have seen in a long time. visually stunning and breathtaking, like a trip to a museum that is rich with colorful paintings. many beautifully chanted songs and little dialog. the best iranian movie i have seen. and on an international level, it&#x27;s the most artistic, yet not boring. the story comes out in colors, songs, and little dialog (suitable for those who don&#x27;t like reading sub-titles).this movie marries a fiction story with a documentary about a tribe and their tradition to make gabbeh, a hand-woven carpet. the screenplay is very original and unusual -- in a good way. it definitely does not follow the clear-cut hollywood recipe. this might confuse some viewers but this movie would be seen as a gem by other viewers who enjoy creativity. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
