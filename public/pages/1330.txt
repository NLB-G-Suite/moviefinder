the performances by the leads are quite charming andeffective. the movie is simple with little added to the genre, but what it does employ is rewarding to the viewer. the idea of ed's fish-out-of-water situation is not overdone or used as a crutch. instead, there are only minimal exaggerated comic moments of stereotypical new york moments. this movie, which i hadnever really heard of, is sweet and filled with endearing characters involved in everyday circumstances.i knew matthew ross looked familiar, and upon glancing at his filmography iwas surprised at how many smarmy characters he has played (usually a littleover the top). he is very charismatic and has a nice naive quality. the lead actress, who looks like annabelle sciorra's (sp?) relative, is also very likable and has a nice chemistry with ross. i was very surprised at how enjoyable this film was. there is not a whole lot to the film, but it is very emotionally rewarding and worth checking out. 4 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
