see all my reviews robin williams is great as a ten year old, who looks like 40. when he plays with his mother (diane lane), explores the world or has a rendez-vous with the mother of his best friend - that is more than well-played. williams as jack: his best role after playing adrian cronauer in &quot;good morning,vietnam&quot;.supported by the lovely, warm performances of jennifer lopez and bill cosby, williams makes &quot;jack&quot; a wonder. you can either love or hate this movie, depending on your rq (=romance quotient). 18 of 31 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 72 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
