creepy and inventive... 20 march 2004 | by saxfiend (tucson, az) &ndash; see all my reviews spawned from a short story by famed novelist stephen king, &quot;the night flier&quot; presents itself as a mystery that never strays far from horror. i honestly believe that this could be one of the most creative films of the '90s. the dark and menacing tone keeps the viewer entranced, while the mysterious elements keep them guessing till the end. the plot is coherent, and never truly strays into cliches. production values, including special effects, for this film are exceptional when compared to similar made-for-cable movies. the cast is led by a composed and disturbing ferrer, though the rest of is forgettable. if you like horror films that are inventive and complex then this film may very well suit you. 11 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
