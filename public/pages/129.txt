trivia "kansas city" is partially based on a true incident. in 1933, mary mcelroy, the opium-addicted daughter of henry mcelroy, kansas city's city manager, was kidnapped from her home by a group of amateur kidnappers. after a $30,000 ransom was paid, mary mcelroy was released unharmed. her four kidnappers were later caught and sentenced to life in prison. see more &raquo; goofs when governor guy park is telephoned about the kidnapping, he suggests notifying the state police. missouri has no state police (only highway patrol). see more &raquo; quotes carolyn stilton: he's got a lot of customers. blondie o'hara: those aren't customers, those are voters. they ship 'em from all over the state. each of 'em vote ten, twelve times. used to get their names outta the cemetary, but i don't even think they bother anymore. johnny flynn: [to crowd of men] you'll be exercising your god-given right to vote. however, you'll be voting the way i tell you to vote, and as many times as i tell you. that understood?
