goofs during the storm on roan inish, there is a shot of the rocks holding down the roof moving quite a bit from the force of the wind. however, the rocks in the background of the cottage next door are absolutely still suggesting that the storm is completely man-made and the crew only had the wind machines on the one cottage. see more &raquo; quotes tess: [to fiona and grandfather] the sea is a sickness and you two will come to grieve for it! see more &raquo; connections featured in the oprah winfrey show: summer movie reviews&nbsp;(1996) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; heartwarming and rich in irish culture, but not in a sappy way 15 march 2003 | by andrew nixon (orders@andrewnixon.com) (santa barbara, ca) &ndash; see all my reviews one of the things i love about the irish culture is it's rich legends and storytelling. this story follows fiona (jeni courtney) who has returned from the city with her father to live with her grandparents. they had previously lived on the island of roan inish, but are now living on the mainland. the director, john sayles, bring us a version of the legend of the selkie, a creature that is half seal-half human. i found this movie to be very heartwarming and rich in irish culture, but not in a sappy way. jeni courtney turns in an excellent and completely believable performance as fiona who learns about the legend of the selkie and uses it to find her little brother jimmy who had disappeared at sea at an infant. the irish landscape and sea are gorgeously filmed and it's as if you are there in ireland learning about the legends yourself through the eyes of fiona.
