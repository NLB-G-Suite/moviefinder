see all my reviews this is an okay movie, but it doesn&#x27;t generate much excitement or suspense because there&#x27;s not much done with the mirror and the characters are not especially interesting. this picture is less about the mirror than it is about this kid&#x27;s history concerning his deceased, murderous father. the only truly interesting characters are the detective, played by the stepfather&#x27;s terry o&#x27;quinn, and llanie. and just like in the previous film, &#x22;it&#x27;s about time&#x22;, there&#x27;s no amityville house either (except in flashbacks). if this really is a new generation, then i would have preferred the old one. **1/2 out of **** 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
