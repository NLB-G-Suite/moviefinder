edit storyline john travolta plays george malley, who owns the local auto repair shop in a small california town. after celebrating his birthday with friends at the local bar/hang-out, george heads for home. he pauses to watch a strange light in the sky, then collapses for a few seconds in the middle of the deserted street. in the days and weeks that follow, george finds his iq and consciousness expanding dramatically, and develops telekinetic abilities. despite his attempts to explain what has happened to him, with just a very few exceptions, most of the local townspeople treat the "new" george as a freak. his state of isolation becomes even more pronounced when his new-found abilities allow him to correctly predict an earthquake, and outside authorities become interested in what's happened to him. written by - written by: r. merriman &lt;wyldberi@msn.com&gt;

see all my reviews this movie was, without a doubt, one of the finest ever made in a long, long time. i was expecting ti to take a sci-fi route with abductions and vulcan mind-melds...but the ending and explanation for george's predicament are not only plausable but heart-breaking. you cannot help but feel for a like george malley. i didn't buy into too much of the hyseria surrounding the townsfolk as it seemed a little &quot;tacked on&quot;...but the performances by travolta, duval, kyra sedgwick and forrest whitaker made up for any shortcomings and plot holes. i have watched this movie time and time again and the combination of true emotional drama and a beautiful score nearly bring me to tears everytime. 9 out of 10. 46 of 57 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
