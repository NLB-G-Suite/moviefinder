plot seemed to be a mix from &quot;cliffhanger&quot; and ron howards &quot;backdraft&quot;. it&acute;s just to bad that &quot;firestorm&quot; doesen&acute;t manage to be anything like either of this good films. don&acute;t gett me wrong, &quot;firestorm&quot; was an ok film in some ways. but in those other ways it wasn&acute;t that great. 5/10 5 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 47 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
