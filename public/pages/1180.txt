user reviews &nbsp; scrumptious darkness 17 january 2008 | by terencebells (los angeles, ca.) &ndash; see all my reviews alain delon and maurice ronnet play a fascinating duet of savage cruelty in this tense beautifully crafted rene clement thriller from patricia highsmith&#39;s pen. anthony minghella remade it as &quot;the talented mr ripley&quot; with a more polished script and some startling character development but &quot;purple noon&quot; has an unbeatable extra gear in alain delon&#39;s portrayal. he is deadly because anyone would have fallen into his trap. his beauty is inviting and reassuring. we witness his brutal side but don&#39;t get to the point of judging him. that is more unique than rare in a movie. delon&#39;s ripley acts as if there was nothing objectionable about his behavior. a poster boy for amorality. marie laforet&#39;s marge is stunningly beautiful but don&#39;t get to know her as well as we do gyneth paltrow in minghella&#39;s version. if you liked the talented mr ripley&quot; you&#39;re going to love &quot;purple noon&quot; and vice-versa. 23 of 27 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 57 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
