user reviews &nbsp; horror movie played for laughs; extremely entertaining 31 january 2007 | by ccthemovieman-1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this is one of the few horror movies i truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. it adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.there&#39;s a lot to like in this kinda-goofy movie: nice visuals; good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story; a small amount of ridiculous theology compare to what usually is offered in this genre, and some totally outrageous scenes. they include a woman&#39;s head loose and then biting a man&#39;s hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it&#39;s own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.my main complaint is not enough lulls. there is too much action, and it&#39;s so intense it&#39;s almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. one needs a break once in a while!there is no credibility in here, but that&#39;s okay since i think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. bruce campell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times but within seconds, he&#39;s back to normal. campell, by the way, must have set the all-time record for making rubber-faced wild faces in a movie, more than jim carrey. however, this movie certainly isn&#39;t one to be scrutinized for realism. you have to look at it, with all the gory scenes and shocking violence as not much more than just tongue-in-cheek satire on horror movies. it&#39;s great fun. 38 of 47 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
