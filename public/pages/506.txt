one hell of a ride 19 september 2016 | by allstarrunner (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews finally another great western movie!to be sure, all the western clich&#xe9;s are found in this movie; and i don&#x27;t have a problem with that! one of the things i liked best about this western was the pacing, sometimes i find westerns to be a little too slow (for my personal taste - subjective, i know) but i felt this movie nailed it, even with a run time a little over 2 hours.the action scenes are great, very well done. the casting and acting was great - denzel does a great job as the leader of this rag tag group of guys. pratt, of course, nails the comedic relief role.the movie carried a surprising amount of &#x22;heart&#x22; throughout it all the way to the end. here is the bottom line: yes, this movie is worth your hard earned money to go see in the theater. 117 of 217 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 340 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
