generally means that the speaker does not make a habit of watching television. it generally does not mean that the speaker avoids television completely and has never seen a single episode of any show ever. most people who &quot;don't watch tv&quot; will watch tv from time to time, depending on the situation at hand. vincent seems to be no exception. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] pumpkin: forget it. too risky. i'm through doing that shit. yolanda: you always say that. that same thing every time, "i'm through, never again, too dangerous". pumpkin: i know that's what i always say. i'm always right, too. yolanda: but you forget about it in a day or two. pumpkin: yeah, well the days of me forgetting are over, and the days of me remembering have just begun. see more &raquo;
