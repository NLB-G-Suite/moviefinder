trivia stephen rea turned down the role of beethoven. see more &raquo; goofs the producers of the film made painstaking effort to ensure that authentic late classical-era pianos were used on set, yet the music that is allegedly coming out of them is unmistakably from a 20th-century instrument. see more &raquo; quotes ludwig van beethoven: [startled to discover he has been tricked into playing piano for people observing him behind the wall] it is terrible, terrible for you to rob me in this way of my most treasured feelings! see more &raquo; connections spoofed in burn-e&nbsp;(2008) see more &raquo; soundtracks für elise written by ludwig van beethoven performed by murray perahia see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews the wild genius 30 august 1998 | by matthew ignoffo (mermatt@webtv.net) (eatontown, nj, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews not quite as dramatic as amadeus, to which there are obvious comparisons, it is a powerful film in its own right. taking the mysterious letter which beethoven wrote to his &quot;immortal beloved&quot; as the starting point, we follow his secretary's attempt to identify the person to whom the letter is addressed. no one knows, to this day, who that person really is, but the film offers an interesting theory. the letter, however, is just a device to tell the story of the wild genius who personifies the romantic movement in art. the letter serves much the same purpose as does rosebud in citizen kane -- a method of stringing together a series of flashbacks that reveal the personality of the central figure. the acting is wonderful and the music is powerful. 20 of 24 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
