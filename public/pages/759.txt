see all my reviews &#x22;addiction: this is not a love story&#x22; is a dark but strong short that deals with a woman&#x27;s life thrown into indecisive heaven/hell as she struggles to maintain a perfect normal and safe life (with a husband and child) and a more secretive, dangerous life with an abusive boyfriend on the side.it shows a very accurate, chaotic mind set/point of view of someone who has/is going through an abusive relationship. the phone calls and constant flip flopping, confusion feels natural and believable, as does the danger and intensity of the consequences of sleeping with such a volatile person. the acting is good, the emotions are strong and i admire the ending&#x27;s authenticity. some of the acting for the male roles could have been better but overall, this an intense experience that really hits home and hits it hard in a very impacting way. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
