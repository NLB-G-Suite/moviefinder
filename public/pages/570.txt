user reviews the best action movie! 4 october 2003 | by 600nitro (here, sometimes) &ndash; see all my reviews since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite. since then i've seen it countless times and i never get tired of it. the setting has a lot to do with it (the colorado i know would be jealous), but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes. there has not been a movie i can compare this too. john lithgow plays a smart villain, but i love how he is completely out of his element--he has to follow tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting. this is an action movie at it's best. i don't think i'll see another that is so entertaining.you don't need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie. it just has to keep you captivated, not shell-shocked. 29 of 46 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
