totally underrated film 30 june 2002 | by riff98 (michigan) &ndash; see all my reviews i went to see this movie in the theater and i have to say that it is one of the most underrated films i have ever seen. this movie received a lot of bad press when it was released but i don't see how it was justified. the story is great and it makes you nervous watching it unfold. you will know what i am talking about if you see it. christopher walken gives another great performance as the &quot;policeman&quot; as he calls himself. walken's voice is one of the best in the business. i highly recommend this movie if you want to be entertained with a great suspenseful film. 25 of 33 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
