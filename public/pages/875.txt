hell no! you run away screaming like hell, find a fire weapon and annihilate anything you see. said this, let's talk about movie.the concept is really cute and the casting is good, but the characters are &quot;thrown&quot; in the story with no background and this can be a fault... the scaring parts are really predictable: music slowly increasing, than stops like &quot;hm everything's alright&quot; then &quot;baaaw!&quot; someone or something pops out. i could turn the volume down every time there was a scary noise part in time :-)the ending is also a bit poor and with the classic &quot;i'll be back!&quot; style.however, not less than 6/10 18 of 25 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
