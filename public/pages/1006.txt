tsk, tsk.the characters are incredibly well-defined and the writing is ingenious. the scene in the apartment when banderas first breaks in and confronts abril is writing at perfection-- this man has forced his way in, but you go from liking him, to hating him, to liking him again in just this short little scene. the history between these characters is truly warped, and that makes this a really enjoyable film to watch, and i'm not just saying that because of the nudity.almodovar may have his obsessions, but that doesn't mean the rest of the movie isn't worth watching. it is, and will make you think, which i know a lot of american film-watchers don't like to do.i had never seen an almodovar film before, but i am so glad i did. makes me want to find out just what else has been out there.artsy little film, with both heads functioning at full capacity. 9/10. 22 of 38 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
