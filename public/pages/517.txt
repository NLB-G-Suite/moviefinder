user reviews &nbsp; how far would you go for a friend? 12 december 2005 | by kristine (kristinedrama14@msn.com) (chicago, illinois) &ndash; see all my reviews this is one of the best adaptions of the vietnam war on film that i have seen. we have also &quot;platoon&quot; that represented somewhat of the same thing that &quot;the deer hunter&quot; did as well, but this one came first and was a great version. it showed the intense horror and ultimate change effect on the men that fought in vietnam. at first, i admit, i was a little bored because the beginning is a little long and felt unnecessary, but then i realized later in the film how much that developed the characters and understood their friendships and how they relate.robert de niro seems to be the strongest one of the group, his name is mike. he has a lot of guts, but he also seems to care mostly about himself, he later on proves that after finally just letting go with his kept up emotions, he must take care of his friends as well. christopher walken, he's a baby in here! he's such a terrific actor and he did so well by portraying innocence in his role and the ultimate insanity of his character. he and robert were amazing, they were just so believable and worked so well together.this was the best picture of 1978, so far i cannot really judge one wither or not it deserved the reward. but it is an awesome movie and i would highly recommend it for anyone. the lines are just f****** a! :d i mean memorable! this does deserve to be on the top 250, good job to other imdb users! 10/10 70 of 124 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
