see all my reviews before roberto benigni proved himself capable of masterpieces with &quot;life is beautiful&quot; (why did he follow it up with that awful &quot;pinocchio&quot;?), he made a number of zany comedies, including &quot;il mostro&quot; (called &quot;the monster&quot; in english). after a string of murders, the police suspect builder loris (benigni). i should identify that they only have circumstantial evidence, but boy is it some funny circumstantial evidence! having &quot;learned&quot; about this man, jessica rossetti (nicoletta braschi) agrees to help nail him. and let me tell you, what she does to try and provoke him into attacking her...well, let's just say that you can't possibly prepare yourself for how funny it is! a hilarious movie in every sense. 7 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
