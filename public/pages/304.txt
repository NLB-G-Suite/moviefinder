some visual effects were not overly done at all and they helped by enhancing the atmosphere and mood of the film. i could feel the fairy dust coming through the screen!! i *loved* this film and would watch it again and again!! a truly heartwarming, magical film!! 13 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
