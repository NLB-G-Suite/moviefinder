see all my reviews only rent or buy this if you like the sort of humour displayed in movies like kung pow and mr. bean. this movie is so stupid that even veterans of the slapstick comedy genre will be cringing. just look at the quotes and you'll have some nice examples of what i mean. &quot;man bush, you have no equal!&quot; the plot is interesting - stanley stupid wakes up one day to discover his garbage stolen again from right outside his own home. determined to find those responsible, he sets off on a quest to find a man called sender, who through... crazy and foolish logic, he believes is planning a worldwide conspiracy to steal the world's garbage.along the way he uncovers a military weapons distributing operation, which forms most of the opposition in the plot, as they try to kill him repeatedly, and through sheer stupidity and luck, he evades them.you can't accuse the story of being clich&eacute; or unoriginal - not many movies involve meeting god in a planetarium.the characters are all uniquely stupid, and while their clothes are as unpleasant as fashion can be, they're all very entertaining. except the daughter, who may annoy more than entertain, but you get those in every movie.all in all, as long as you're looking for a film with humour so.. stupid, you'll wet yourself, then you'll probably laugh yourself silly watching this. i first saw it back in 1997 or so, and only managed to find the video last year on ebay. it's a fairly rare video, i think, but i'm hoping it'll come out in region 2 dvd before long :) rent/buy? the humour can be a specialised taste. i'd recommend renting it, but if you can buy it for a reasonable price, i recommend buying it in case you do like it, because it's pretty rare. 17 of 24 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
