this movie is how you uplift our people 4 march 2010 | by jensyao (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews you cannot deny the timeless performance done by our actors to portray the black panthers at their finest. the long lost quotations said by martin and malcolm buried in the sands of time has left our next generation watered down of its glory and deprived of our will to uplift our people. by revisiting the mentality of the black panthers, we are able to learn from the past and reiterate the fact that that there is always room for improving oneself as well as the community. today&#x27;s rap scene of glorifying gangs and portraying crime and violence has no place in society and leads to more people getting killed. we must show this movie to our teens so that they understand they come from a bloodline of proud individuals who want the next generation to carry on their legacy. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
