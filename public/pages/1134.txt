another opinion 11 july 2005 | by joe williams (jdwilliams-2) (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews as far as comments about roeg's going overboard with his message of &quot;nature/aborigine good, industrialisation/white men bad,&quot; this is a simplistic way of reading it. first of all, every director has his or her own style, and roeg started as a cinematographer--his movies tend to contain long, meditative (or, boring, depending on one's view) visual passages. roeg floods the screen with cascades of images, by turns repetitive and contrasting, much as a poet uses the sounds and rhythms of words, as well as their semantic content, to create &quot;meaning&quot; in the context of the poem.to expect roeg not to dwell on images is to expect tolstoy not to go off on 20-page rants about how the lack of napoleon would necessitate another to fill his historical role. one overlooks idiosyncracies in one's friends.i found the movie much more powerful than i expected. my only disappointment with the criterion dvd release is with the commentaries. i would love to have heard more about the story, and it would have been nice to have heard from david gulpilil, whose role as the aborigine was a watershed in australian cinema, as noted in the imdb article on his career. 40 of 51 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
