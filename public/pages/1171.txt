(the music on young guns is totally different, very inferior, and does not help to accentuate emotions at all.) on this note: anyone who says that jon bon jovi did the music for this film is very mistaken. he wrote a couple of songs that appear on the end credits (and an album that was *inspired by* the movie) but silvestri is the one who created one of the best movie scores i've heard, which is nearly as good as his back to the future music. (shame it isn't available to buy anywhere.)now back to the film. it's both entertaining and moving, and also very funny and i highly recommend it. like a previous commenter said, there's no need to see the first film as this one stands on its own very well and totally surpasses its predecessor. 8/10. 14 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 71 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
