user reviews &nbsp; one of the all-time great westerns 15 june 2006 | by ccthemovieman-1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews one of the best and most-liked films of the 1960s, this is still a fun movie to watch today. when i saw this on dvd on a nice flat-screen set, i was amazed how good this looked. i had seen it several times before on vhs and hadn&#39;t realized how good this was photographed. i just discovered conrad hall was the cinematographer, which explains it. few, if any, were better than him.one remembers this western for several things: the two leads looking over their shoulders incredulous that their pursers seem to be always there; paul newman riding a bicycle to the tune of &quot;raindrops keep falling on my head,&quot; the beautiful katharine ross, the chemistry of newman and robert redford as a two-man team, on and on. those three lead actors, with the repartee between them, and the likability of each, make them fun to watch as they dominate this picture. it&#39;s just solid entertainment and another example of good film-making that doesn&#39;t need a lot of r-rated material to make it successful. photography-wise, the western scenery was great, there were some wonderful closeup shots and i really liked the tinted old-time footage inserted in here. so, when you combine all the elements, it&#39;s no surprise this film won so many awards and endures so well. 44 of 52 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
