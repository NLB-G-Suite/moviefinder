five teenage girls make a family 26 june 2006 | by galadriel-13 (minneapolis, united states) &ndash; see all my reviews four teenage girls are joined by legs (played by jolie). experiencing various teenage anxieties and failed communication with parents, they form a strong emotional bond which is augmented by events in which they take part together and into which they are drawn. supporting each other, they play the role of both friend and family to each other.the plot deals with the isolation of late teenage from mainstream society and one&#39;s parents&#39; generation, and the communication divide which neither parents nor children seem to be able to bridge easily during these years. another theme is what too much pain and abandonment in the early years can do to you, and how good people can clash with a society trying to do the right thing, but getting it wrong. 10 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
