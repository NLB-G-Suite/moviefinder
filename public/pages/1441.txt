instead of a husband going out to create a fantasy, it's all there under his own roof. be who you want to be at any time, not just on halloween :-) although it would probably be considered an abnormal state of affairs ... then again, from what we see today at the movies or on tv, maybe it would be accepted. for sure, watching this movie would make you want to try when you see the end results. i enjoyed every minute of it. the tv guide only had two and a half stars against it. i would have given it four!!! 12 of 18 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
