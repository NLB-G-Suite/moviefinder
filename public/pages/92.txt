user reviews very under-appreciated 26 september 1998 | by shawn hopkins (stuhopsw@acs.eku.edu) (richmond, ky) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie was great. i was shocked to see no one had posted a comment on it. a fantastic performance by heather matazarro. the movie is all about growing up in a world that expects you to already be an adult. because dawn weiner is &quot;ugly&quot; she is mistreated, harassed, and ignored by everyone she comes across. i don't think i've ever seen a movie that featured a character more emotional alone. there is a scene where dawn's mother offers dawn's dessert to her siblings to get back at her. they take it, eagerly. most movies like this are either black comedies or feature a character who is stoicaly non-conformist or just stoic. dawn is neither. she bleeds, right up until the movies end, which i won't spoil but i will say that it is all the more heartbreaking for its inertia as for its action. go find this one. you'll either love it or hate it. it's not a movie that just lets you go. 31 of 36 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
