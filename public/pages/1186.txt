edit did you know? trivia one of ernst lubitsch's techniques to protect his star was having jack benny do multiple takes of many of his crucial scenes. robert stack recalled that "specifically, the scene where jack comes home and finds me in his bed asleep and does a series of double takes, he made jack do at least 30 takes." still, lubitsch respected benny's opinion and would redo a scene if benny himself, after looking at the rushes, thought it could be better. see more &raquo;
