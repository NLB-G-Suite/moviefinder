user reviews &nbsp; great movie! 8 august 2004 | by movie nuttball (u.s.a.) &ndash; see all my reviews i have always like this great baseball movie! it has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites danny glover and christopher lloyd! also in this movie is ben johnson, brenda fricker, big tony longo, tony danza, and matthew mcconaughey! also jay o. sanders and dermot mulroney! the film has great special effects and acting from all of the film's actors! the baseball scenes are all realistic! the music by composer randy edelman is very good and it fits the film very well! some of the actors who reminded me the actual baseball personalities. stoney jackson's ray mitchell character reminded me royce clayton, mcconaughey's character reminded me of steve finley, and jay o. sanders's commentator in my opinion resembled how al hrabosky looks today. this is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and i strongly recommend this film! 14 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
