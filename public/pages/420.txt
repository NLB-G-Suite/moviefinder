out. it&#x27;s one of the few cotc films that i remember renting in video stores along with cotc ii. i developed a crush on naomi watts and wanted to see her in more things and later on she became the scream queen for classy horror films i never understood why all 90&#x27;s films have the same sideways camera angle but hopefully i&#x27;m not the only one who has noticed this. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
