trivia locations in the film's fantastical "book world" are primarily based on three novels - strange case of dr. jekyll and mr. hyde by robert louis stevenson, for the segment set in horror and moby-dick by herman melville, and treasure island by robert louis stevenson, for the segment set in adventure. the segment set in fantasy uses various fairy tale tropes, but also the beanstalk from jack and the beanstalk fairy tale. some of the other books seen or used in the film are the hound of the baskervilles by sir arthur conan doyle (the hound has a cameo in the film when it jumps out of the book), twenty thousand leagues under the sea by jules verne (the giant squid is summoned by fantasy) and middle eastern fairy tale collection one thousand and one nights (fantasy summons the flying magic carpet from it). also, the character of horror (the anthropomorphic book) resembles a lot to quasimodo, the tragic protagonist of the hunchback of notre-dame by victor hugo. see more &raquo; goofs during the scene in which the main characters first enter the cave/dragon's mouth, adventure is overjoyed to find his sword. however, he never lost his sword in previous scenes. after humpty dumpty falls, you can see both richard's glasses and adventure's sword being carried by the pixies into the cave mouth. see more &raquo; quotes richard tyler: [to adventure] you guys are the only friends i ever had. see more &raquo; crazy credits the original vhs release of the film contained a sneak preview of mighty morphin power rangers: the movie prior to the film. see more &raquo; connections referenced in estrenos cr&iacute;ticos: especial series americanas&nbsp;(2011) see more &raquo; soundtracks whatever you imagine lyric by cynthia weil music by barry mann and james horner produced by keith thomas executive producer: jay landers performed by wendy moten wendy moten courtesy of thunderbird records/emi records see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; j&#x27;adore! 10 june 2010 | by fanny (sweden) &ndash; see all my reviews it&#x27;s in the middle, by the waterfall! - no, it&#x27;s east.. by somebroccoli.i&#x27;m sorry. but i absolutely love this movie! i remember it so well from when i was a kid, how i watched it over and over again, never getting tired of it. for years i have been wanting to see it again, but i couldn&#x27;t remember what it was called. and when i finally found it, i was a bit scared to actually see it. i mean, whenever you have had so high expectations on a movie (especially one that you&#x27;ve seen and loved as a child) you always in some way get more or less disappointed. but this time i have to say i didn&#x27;t! sure, the colors and contrast isn&#x27;t as powerful as it could be and the part where he gets chased by the color isn&#x27;t half as realistic as i remembered it too be, but for a 4-yearold (which i was at the time this came out) it&#x27;s more than enough to get the engines running! this movie is partially responsible for my massive interest and collection of fantasy-books and movies at home, as well as my ridiculous fear of thunder. i mean, come on, it&#x27;s really nicely put together! it&#x27;s got it all! plus, even if they are only in there for a short period of time, you build up an interest for all the stories you come across throughout the story, like moby dick and dr jekyll. and that was the intention of the maker of this move, right? to get the children into reading. at least i remember asking my mum to read all those stories to me after seeing this! okey, maybe i&#x27;m letting myself get a bit carried away.. i&#x27;ll be honest, if i hadn&#x27;t seen this as a kid or had kids myself, i probably wouldn&#x27;t think that much of it. it&#x27;s a bit dated which we all can tell and with todays technology you could make this 10 times better . but setting that aside, this is a timeless story! and i hope that when i have kids myself, this movie will help them get their lazy asses away from the computer and into the library.in the end i will not rate this movie from an adult living in our time&#x27;s point of view, but from the heart of a little girl. and never the less, this adults heart still beats hard for this movie. 8 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
