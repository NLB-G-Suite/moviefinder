user reviews &nbsp; great and powerful movie, liam neeson at his best! 18 june 2007 | by aida nejad (gothenburg, sweden) &ndash; see all my reviews steven spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. liam neeson gives a great performance as schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the movie is so good. ralph fiennes makes an even better performance as goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. i read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but i think it&#x27;s a classic and it&#x27;ll never go away. so if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go see schindler&#x27;s list.edit: i wrote this when i was 12 or 13, and i&#x27;m so sorry about my awful english... ah, well just have that in mind when you read this. =) 181 of 262 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
