the water and mountains seemed destined for that shot, but didn't deliver. the boy was too old, the voice of the &quot;uncle&quot; in the sky didn't work, but generally it was a deeply moving experience, rising to a terrific climax in her suicide and his remorse. that last closeup of pinkerton, racked by remorse, lifting the dying butterfly, was powerful. the film aired in canada on aug 8 on the bravo! tv network. i couldn't tear myself away to get to a party till the final credits were rolling. 3 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
