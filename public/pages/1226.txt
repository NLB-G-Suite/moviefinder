frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews effective buddy movie 8 march 1999 | by al-80 (brighton, england) &ndash; see all my reviews with no plot and very little in the way of action, it is amazing that this little film works so effectively. basically a day-in-the-life tale following the misfortunes of two drug addicts, stretch (roth) &amp; spoon (shakur), as they desperately try to kick heroin and avoid the unfortunate attention of a local gangster (curtis-hall). the dialogue is sparky and funny, and the two leads are very impressive. shakur is a true revelation, and roth plays the part he always plays very well. the film tries to be very moral at times, but isn't, and the music in the film steps on the wrong side of ridiculous. but as a good night in front of the tv, gridlock'd succeeds magnificently. 13 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
