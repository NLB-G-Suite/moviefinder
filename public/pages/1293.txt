guess 11 may 2006 | by lee eisenberg (lee.eisenberg.pdx@gmail.com) (portland, oregon, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;inventing the abbotts&quot; seems like the sort of movie that they just made for no particular reason. portraying some relationships in 1957 illinois, the movie is worth seeing. maybe not any kind of masterpiece, but interesting. i liked the fake sideburns scene, and the, uh, scene under the table. joaquin phoenix was showing the same acting skills that he later brought to &quot;gladiator&quot; and &quot;walk the line&quot;, and liv tyler, billy crudup, and jennifer connelly also did quite well.i guess that overall, there&#39;s nothing really unique here. there have been many slice-of-life stories. but this one is pretty well done with some good performances. worth seeing. 14 of 19 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
