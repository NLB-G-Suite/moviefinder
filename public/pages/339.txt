don't say to say the third one was a dream, because then that would be corny and immature. i thought that the story was very good. the characters, although slightly wooden, were very well drawn. several people say that the old ripley was gone, but by the end of the film, she was acting just like the good ol' gal we all know and love. and something that only one critic acknowledged was this: the newborn alien. wow! that thing was ugly and scary as hell! that's the type of alien you need for the ending. you've been seeing the same old alien for 3.75 films now, and you've pretty much gotten scared by the creatures as much as you could, why not bring some fresh meat on the scene? and plus, you have to include the alien tradition of battling a new alien at the end of each film. in the first one, ripley battled a normal alien. in the second one, ripley battled a queen. and in the third one, ripley battled a dog alien. to continue the tradition, ripley battled a human alien. and if i may say, that thing is the scariest of them all. what i don't understand is that everyone says that this series ran out of steam by the beginning of the third one. i disagree. the alien films still have a flare going, but a fifth one would be all that you could have before the flame burns out. i expect the fifth to be really good, but also tie up the entire story and give an accurate epilogue to the series. and think about this: you're not going to resurrect a series like this just so that you can end the series again just before the credits of the said film. alien resurrection was a good movie, and i think that it was as innovative as a third alien sequel could be. 48 of 77 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
