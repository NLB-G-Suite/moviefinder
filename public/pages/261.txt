edit did you know? trivia during filming, several of the actors portraying u.s.s. dallas crewmen, took a cruise on a real submarine. to train for his role as the dallas' commander, scott glenn was installed as a "co-commander" of the real sub. the real commander ordered his crew to first give report to him, then give the same report to glenn. glenn was so impressed with the commander, he basically played that man in the film. always giving orders in a calm quiet voice, even in tense situations. see more &raquo; goofs at the joint chiefs' briefing, ryan notes that the date is the 23rd. at about the same time on the red october, the political officer reads aloud orders that direct the sub to return &quot;on or about the 16th of this month,&quot; which has already passed by a week. see more &raquo; quotes capt. vasili borodin: i will live in montana. and i will marry a round american woman and raise rabbits, and she will cook them for me. and i will have a pickup truck... maybe even a "recreational vehicle." and drive from state to state. do they let you do that? captain ramius: i suppose. capt. vasili borodin: no papers? captain ramius: no papers, state to state. capt. vasili borodin: well then, in winter i will live in... arizona. actually, i think i will need two wives. captain ramius: oh, at least. see more &raquo;

user reviews best film of tom clancy 6 july 2002 | by bill kinder (wmkinder@aol.com) (pennsylvania) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie never fails to entertain me. smartly directed, well written, and acted it always brings a fresh newness no matter how many times i've seen it. it could have been the beginning of a franchise for alec baldwin. he is very much centered and controlled. sean connery is also standout.could recommend this to anyone without hesitation. on dvd it's a visual feast. just a great looking movie. wish that all the other clancy books had been adapted so well. 27 of 32 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
