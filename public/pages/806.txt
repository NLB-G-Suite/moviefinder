see all my reviews the best documentary about jazz ever. if you want to know what jazz performers are like, you will learn more from this one hour film than all the hours of ken burns' documentary put together. it makes burns' film insignificant by comparison. jazz performers shine in this work because jean bach is such a skillful interviewer. you can tell the musicians all like her, and since they are always shown talking to the camera, not to her, it comes across as if they all like you, too, the viewer. the film makes you feel very privileged. i own this film and i watch it over and over and never get tired of it. who could get tired of hanging out for an hour with dizzy gillespie, sonny rollins, bud freeman, art farmer, etc. and listening to the excellent narration of quicy jones? 4 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
