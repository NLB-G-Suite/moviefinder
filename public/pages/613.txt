"hall" confronts his venom-spewing elder, mr. "cayhall," about the murders. the next day, headlines run proclaiming adam the grandson who has come to the state to save his grandfather, the infamous ku klux klan bomber. while the old man's life lies in the balance, adam's motivation in fighting this battle becomes clear as the story unfolds. not only does he fight for his grandfather, but perhaps for himself as well. he has come to heal the wounds of his own father's suicide, to mitigate the secret shame he has always felt for the ... written by mark fleetwood &lt;mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu&gt; plot summary | add synopsis plot keywords: death | murder | death sentence | bomber | klansman |&nbsp;see all (88)&nbsp;&raquo; taglines: time is running out. genres: crime&nbsp;| drama motion picture rating (mpaa) rated r for violent images and some language | see all certifications&nbsp;&raquo; parents guide: view content advisory&nbsp;&raquo; edit details country: usa language: english release date: 11 october 1996 (usa) see more&nbsp;&raquo; also known as: die kammer see more&nbsp;&raquo; filming locations: chicago, illinois, usa see more&nbsp;&raquo; box office budget: $50,000,000 (estimated) opening weekend: $5,612,095 (usa) (11 october 1996) gross: $14,402,821 (usa) (13 december 1996) see more&nbsp;&raquo; company credits production co: universal pictures, imagine entertainment, davis entertainment see more&nbsp;&raquo; show detailed company contact information on imdbpro&nbsp;&raquo; technical specs runtime: 113 min sound mix: dts | dts-stereo color: color aspect ratio: 2.35 : 1 see full technical specs&nbsp;&raquo; edit did you know? trivia one of three cinema movies where actor gene hackman played a character with the first name of "sam". the feature films are bite the bullet (1975) - sam clayton ; company business (1991) - sam boyd ; and the chamber (1996) - sam cayhall. see more &raquo; goofs as adam watches, the digital led clock in his hotel room changes from 3:59 to 4:00 am, and makes a faint click as it does. clocks of this kind do not make such sounds. see more &raquo; quotes sam cayhall: if you spend half as much time trying to be a lawyer instead of trying to be dick tracy, i might not be dead in five days. see more &raquo; connections referenced in conspiracy theory&nbsp;(1997) see more &raquo; soundtracks temenos (here come the shakes) written by shelby tate performed by remy zero courtesy of dgc records by arrangement with mca special markets &amp; products see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews excellent 18 june 2000 | by chuck-195 (canada) &ndash; see all my reviews just like the book, this movie is amazing. the story is unique in the sense that it is very personal. a boy's grandfather is to be executed for murdering two small children, and as he investigates the crime further, he discovers more terrifying secrets about his grandfather and his past. he knows little about his roots because his father commited suicide when he was a kid, and this may be the only chance he has at discovering who he is, however unpleasant it may be. chris odonnel is great in this and gene hackman shines. i give this **** out of **** stars. 13 of 23 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 48 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: e. garner goodman rollie wedge donnie cayhall sgt. clyde packer nora stark gov. david mcallister judge flynn f. slattery atty. gen. roxburgh wyn lettner j.b. gullitt marvin b. kramer ruth kramer josh kramer ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
