see all my reviews this is an absolute perfect movie in every way.storyline,acting,settings---everything is perfect.hollywood used to make great movies like this before it became the special effects driven computer generated movie making schlock capitol of the world.the great paul newman plays a prisoner locked up in a southern jail after a night of petty crimes.his constant struggle to be free even while locked up makes this one of the greatest roles ever seen in a movie.newman is at his absolute peak playing the cool lucas jackson.i was so struck by newman&#39;s performance in this movie i was determined to name my son lucas jackson,but alas,i only had daughters and my wife wasn&#39;t too thrilled about naming either of them lucas.oh well.george kennedy plays jackson&#39;s enemy turned buddy and he is absolutely perfect also.his portrayal of dragline is kennedy at his finest.the sublime strother martin plays the prison captain and damn is he ever good.he was always so underrated as is kennedy too,i think.in fact this whole movie is full of familiar faces that would go on to other big time roles in tv and movies.in this movie everyone meshes perfectly to create an unforgettable movie that will stay with you long after many other movies you&#39;ve seen fade from memory.you must see this movie. 61 of 114 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
