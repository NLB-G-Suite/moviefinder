user reviews &nbsp; small town america according to william inge 11 november 2007 | by janiceferrero (virgin islands) &ndash; see all my reviews there is so much to enjoy in this american melodrama with a deliciously miscast william holden and a gelid, beautiful kim novak that the film can be seen again and again without being disturbed by the 40 year old holden playing the drop out stallion trying to make amends with his past forging a sort of future for himself, at least that&#39;s what i think he wants and i&#39;m sticking with that notion. holden plays the loser with his shiny boots and smallish brain and that&#39;s what reminds us this is just a romantic drama thought by william inge with a patina of reality and that&#39;s all that is real, the patina. i didn&#39;t care that emotionally couldn&#39;t play because emotionally worked for me thanks to the sexual power of the miscast star. william holden is a sort of god who awakes the (seemingly) heavily sedated novak into a towering passion. i would have too. the supporting cast is sensational. rosalind russell is a jarring masterpiece of an over the top clich&egrave;. the old maid, school teacher with a taste for alcohol and an understandable terror of her own future, overtaking her at an incredible speed. susan strasberg, in the part created by kim stanley on the broadway stage is delightful but made me wonder what kim stanley may have done with that part. betty field is the one character that expresses the most saying the least. she, as per usual, is outstanding. all in all, a film/play that shouldn&#39;t be dismissed. 30 of 35 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
