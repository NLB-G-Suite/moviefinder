downey&#x27;s masterpiece 20 august 2010 | by jay raskin (orlando, united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i&#x27;m generally not a fan of robert downey senior&#x27;s movies. his characters tend to be cartoons and his episodic style means that we seem to be watching a series of &#x22;saturday night&#x22; comedy sketches. &#x22;hugo pool&#x22; has enough great actors in it that all the usual faults are turned into virtues. it also has a sweetness and heart that i haven&#x27;t seen in any other downey film.the film is dedicated to downey&#x27;s wife and co-writer laura ernst. she died of the same terrible disease that the character played by patrick dempsey has. it is amazing how downey shows the disease, but never lets us get sentimental over it or be afraid of it. it is just one more comic element in the film. i hope laura coped with it as well as patrick dempsey&#x27;s character does.the stand out performance here is by malcolm mcdowell. his portrayal of an old drug addict trying to kick the &#x22;ding, dang, du&#x22; is charming and funny and sad all at once. the only unfortunate thing is that he&#x27;s only on screen for about 20 minutes.i think the harsher criticisms of this film are by people who expected a more realistic, integrated film. if you willing to give downey his quirky style, this film is sweet and delightful. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
