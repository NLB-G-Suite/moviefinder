i mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and barry lyndon has a definite irony, but i hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. i had known for a while that this was the highest rated kubrick film here on imdb, so naturally, i was excited to find out if it was really his best film. even though i haven't seen lolita, spartacus, eyes wide shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though i thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. the film was made during the cold war, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on kubrick's side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. so, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. personally, i think he did a damn good job of it. i haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, i might never have. the comedy isn't overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. no dumb stereotypes, no old clich&eacute;s... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. the plot is excellent, and very well-paced. in my opinion, kubrick's most well-paced film. the plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. the acting is flawless. absolutely flawless. not something completely unusual for a kubrick film, but still. george c. scott and peter sellers are amazing. normally, i'm not too fond of sellers, but here he was brilliant. the characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. the cinematography is great. just like kubrick's other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in kubrick's films, which is quite impressive. the dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. plenty of quotable lines. i can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so i'll just suggest you see it. seriously, if you enjoy kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you're going to enjoy this film. maybe not as much as i did, but you'll most likely laugh. a lot. i recommend this to any fan of kubrick, black comedies, peter sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. i can't praise it enough. see it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. you won't regret it. i know i didn't. not by a long shot. hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10 128 of 207 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
