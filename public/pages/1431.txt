frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; awesome movie! 23 june 2005 | by tlcfortigers (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this was a heartfelt movie. especially since i live in henrietta texas. i have lived here for about 6 years now and enjoy this small little town. people in this town are so sweet and hard working. so this movie caught my heart a little more being that i live here. we have very old buildings, houses, churches and a lot of history. we have an annual pioneer reunion every september, i believe going on 78 years now. our old jail museum is a sight and it has a lot of history as well. our courthouse is absolutely beautiful. if anyone ever gets a chance come see our little town. a lot of people will come here and say there isn't much to do here but if you get the right person they can show you so much history. i believe our school system uses this movie for a homework project as well. there were a lot of great actors in this movie that nailed the personalities around here. 5 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
