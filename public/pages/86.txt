(i further confess i didn't first watch the movie until some three years after its debut because of its title. i was damned if i wanted to spend two hours in the presence of someone as nasty-seeming as fischer. but the title of course was fred waitzkin's, the author of the source book. fred, you cost me a few years -- but steven zaillian has made up for it many times over.) 24 of 32 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 83 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: tunafish father tournament director school teacher fighting parent man of many signals ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
