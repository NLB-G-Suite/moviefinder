see all my reviews this movie is brilliant. the scams these guys pull are genius and the comic timing is superb. the first scam deals with artificial intelligence and the exaggeration grows as they scam more people. the lead american actor is really handsome, too. this one is right up there with lock, stock and 2 smoking barrels, except without the violence. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
