frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; now i know why i never heard of this movie 6 february 2007 | by k_wyskers_m (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews with such a good cast, i was shocked i had not heard of this movie. but after watching it, now i understand. it was a pretty good idea for a movie, but not executed very well. i just felt like sean penn had all these great ideas and grand schemes for an intense movie. but instead of focusing in on one solid motif, he threw too many concepts and character issues into the mix. the entire stripper / sexual sub plot with jack could have been completely left out. there was not a lot of depth behind the acting, it was just kinda there.like i mentioned, the plot line kinda skated on the surface of being deep. nothing about the movie really touched me. especially considering i lost a family member in a similar way, i thought i would be crying my heart out. but honestly i found it barely entertaining. but if nothing is on tv and the internet isn&#39;t working, i suggest watching it. 10 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
