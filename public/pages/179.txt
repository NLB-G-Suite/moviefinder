i think they should have left well enough alone. i had to go get an old vhs copy of the movie to see it as it was originally filmed. just because you can change something because of technology doesn&#x27;t mean you should. they should have left it alone. 8 of 21 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
