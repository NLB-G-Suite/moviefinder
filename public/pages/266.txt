trivia many character names are symbolic. "vincent" = "he shall conquer," which is what a "freeman" does. detective hugo coldspring = human genome organization, which operates out of the cold spring harbor laboratory. "caesar" = julius caesar, who suffered from epilepsy. ernest borgnine typically plays strong leader roles, but here is limited to being a cleaner. "cassini" = cassini's division in the rings of saturn, the destination of vincent' flight. "josef" = josef mengele, an ss doctor responsible for 'medical experiments' (might this be a mistake for 'gregor' = gregor mendel, father of genetics). "eugene" = eugenics, a program to 'improve' humans by selective breeding. "flatfoot", used as an insult for a policeman, is also a genetically influenced condition. when marie and antonio consult the genetic counselor, they specify 'blue eyes, brown hair, and fair skin." the dark-eyed, head-shaved black counselor repeats these back, with a slight smile of condescension. see more &raquo; goofs jerome rips his jacket sleeve seam while punching out the police officer, yet soon after it is intact. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] director josef: you keep your work station so clean, jerome. vincent: it's next to godliness. isn't that what they say? director josef: godliness. i reviewed your flight plan. not one error in a million keystrokes. phenomenal. it's right that someone like you is taking us to titan. vincent: has the committee approved the mission? there's been talk of delay. director josef: you shouldn't listen to talk. you leave in a week. you've got a substance test. see more &raquo; crazy credits after the credits complete, there is slow-motion footage, tinted blue, of the fingernails from the first scene hitting the pavement. see more &raquo; connections featured in the 55th annual golden globe awards&nbsp;(1998) see more &raquo; soundtracks nuages written by django reinhardt &amp; jacques larue see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how did irene cross the highway that easily? isn't that extremely dangerous? q: is in fact that song only playable if you have twelve fingers? see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; uses science fiction to explore ideas, and reveal some depths of the human spirit 2 july 2001 | by taishi81 (ventura, ca) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;there is no gene for the human spirit.&quot; this is the tag line of the movie gattaca, a film that searches deep within the heart of man. this is one of ethan hawke's strongest performances as a man who refuses to trust the odds, and relies on fate and sheer will to achieve his dreams. he borrows the body of a man without dreams, played by jude law in his best performance to date as well. law simply captures every scene with his sly intelligence and deeply darkened soul. he has no illusions about life, or himself, and he is the perfect counterpoint to hawke's unrelenting dreamer.the performances only enhance, however, a wonderful script by first time writer/director andrew niccol. it deals with science fiction and the future in the best way, by exploring ideas. he quickly and easily presents a future not unimaginable, and truly existing in a &quot;not-too-distant future.&quot; genetic engineering is happening today all the time in areas outside the human species, and sometimes within. how long will it take before the gloves are taken off and science truly starts to decide the type of people humanity will become? what issues will be addressed when that time comes? niccol addresses many of them already, mostly dealing with the discrimination that would probably take place in society. the most subtle and yet important question he asks though is whether a man is truly the sum of his genes, or could his spirit somehow carry him beyond all expectations? such thoughts are dealt with through intelligent characters given intelligent diolague and placed with intelligent situations. it is interesting how such a thoughtful picture can be at time a real thriller to watch as well.gattaca is one of my favorite movies because it is not afraid to address important issues that are truly current in modern day society, and do it with great thought and heart. it wisely stresses the subtle theological questions of whether man ought to tamper with god's work, and whether the result would be a better society, or a better humanity. 149 of 170 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 650 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: personnel officer ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
