see all my reviews while it is difficult to separate oneself from the politics of &quot;the troubles&quot; i think its important to keep in mind that this is a film, not a documentary. its goal is to be historically authentic, not accurate. the message is one that speaks to mothers on all sides of the political divide. i think that one of the reviewers unfortunately missed the point of the movie which is featured in the title.as a film this is an incredibly moving portrait of the horror, sacrifice and absurdity of war. the cast is outstanding; helen mirren is simply stunning, fionnula flanagan gives a powerful performance, aidan gillen is stirring as helen mirren&#39;s son and bobby sands&#39; cell mate and finally john lynch portrays the role of bobby sands quite fairly. the writers and director terry george and jim sheridan have done an outstanding job writing and filming a story that transcends conflict and speaks to humanity we all share. while it shows the injustice of the position from which many of the north ireland catholics faced (and therein lies its political slant) the title firmly roots this film as so much more. i highly recommend this film for its historical authenticity and the brilliant performance by helen mirren. 8 of 22 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
