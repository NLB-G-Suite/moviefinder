user reviews &nbsp; it's not officially christmas season until i watch this movie 5 november 2002 | by brianlion (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i am so glad frank capra had a vision to make &quot;it's a wonderful life&quot;. i'm glad he chose jimmy stewart to play george bailey. there are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. it is not officially the christmas season without watching this little gem. the supporting cast is perfectly matched. donna reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. this would be a great movie, even if it were not in a christmas setting. the holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. a angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but capra pulls it off. the impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. what would life be like for your family if you had never been born? our actions do speak loudly. in an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. the values of &quot;it's a wonderful life&quot; still hold true today. yes, i'll say it, it's a wonderful movie. 147 of 174 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 737 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
