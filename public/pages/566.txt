a treat for action fans and a must have for home theater enthusiasts.7.65/10 for entertainment, 6.7/10 overall.delton 15 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 64 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: dove ----------- more... create &raquo; ?
