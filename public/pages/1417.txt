edit did you know? trivia in the scene with lydia and the stew pot, dry ice was used to give the impression of vapors and heat. however, a small fire was lit under it, and when filming resumed, between takes marlene dietrich assumed there was no real heat and suffered second-degree burns to her hand. she refused to hold up production and instead kept dipping her hand in the pot that had been refilled with ice water. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews marlene dietrich plays an european gypsy woman in pre-world war ii europe. ray milland played the british officer denistoun who is on a mission. ray milland and marlene dietrich are excellent, entertaining, and enjoyable in the film. the story is fine and could have used more work but the milland&#x27;s british gentleman turned gypsy in order to escape the nazis does a fantastic job. it&#x27;s interesting to see a character like denistoun to transform into a gypsy. the ending is worth watching the film. the film doesn&#x27;t address the nazi war crimes. european gypsies were also targeted and persecuted by the nazis during world war ii. still, this film is entertaining to watch and suspenseful. the cast is first rate in the hollywood studio system factory where films were made faster even with mediocre scripts. still, this film is one of my favorites with marlene dietrich. 5 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
