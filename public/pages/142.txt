(no faked up pretty face with shaved chest and oiled muscles). he is cool without pretending to be cool. he manages to thwart the bad guys while barefoot, man that is a great twist.the plot is great because it does not fall perfectly in line for the hero. he stumbles, gets stuck and survives only by last minute thinking. it has plenty of action without getting ridiculous.and the bad guys are great, smart sinister and well acted.it is one of those movies that could play every weekend and would still be watched. is one of those top 10 movies every guy should own.die hard 2 was ok but not as good as the original, i wish they would have stopped after 2. die hard 3 is poor. 106 of 189 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 730 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
