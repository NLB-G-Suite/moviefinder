see all my reviews one of the best and my favorite comedy movies ever! i have watched it at least 7 times and found it funny each time. all those guys saying this part is not as good as the first one, must be out of their sense of humor! this part lives up to its expectations and i found it even funnier than the first part. you might get bored watching the first part 3 or 4 times but not this part! this is a must see film if you haven't seen it already. i own its dvd and keep it very close to my dvd player all the times...never know when i'd like to watch it again :-) i would give it a well deserving 10 out of 10, it cant get any better than this. i really feel sorry for those who didn't find it funny. please don't miss it...watch it today!!! highly recommended!!!! 30 of 41 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
