9 december 2009 | by ihdg_2334 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews granted, i understand how others were expecting adventure kind of things in this movie but it was not bad at all. this movie was more, how i like to say nonfiction than fiction meaning that it tells of what really happens without exaggerating the facts like most movies do. most people who gave it a low rating were expecting exaggerated things, amazing adventure like no other and hence they were disappointed. this move, though short (that&#x27;s what i thought), was simple and sensitive. the ending was rather lame they could have spiced it up like sending the guy to jail or something like that but right afterward you see the female whale give birth-hence with the facts without being too much like a lot of movies are nowadays. so this movie deserves a solid &#x22;a&#x22; and even sisko and ebert gave it two thumps up and they are movie experts, so there you go. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 23 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
