but it still serves a movie that keeps your attention the old fashioned way, reveal a piece of information but don't tell all of it. denzel does a good job and don cheadle gives a great performance as mouse. i hope the rest of walter mosley's books become films because if this is any indication of how the rest will be made. 17 of 23 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
