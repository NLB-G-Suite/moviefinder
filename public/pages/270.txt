user reviews the epitome of romantic! 17 november 1999 | by topdawg (seattle, wa) &ndash; see all my reviews romantic is the word for this movie. the story, the settings, everything adds up to romantic. and it's clean - no gratuitous sex scenes or foul language! a rarity for a 90s movie. this movie has a timeless quality to it, and part of the reason is the (again) extremely romantic score! many critics panned this version of &quot;sabrina&quot;, unfairly comparing it to the original audrey hepburn &quot;sabrina&quot;. nobody could ever compare to audrey hepburn, but julia ormond is a fine sabrina in her own right. she makes the transition from awkward teen to glamorous woman with subtlety and grace. greg kinnear shows a natural flair for acting in his first major movie role. 8 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
