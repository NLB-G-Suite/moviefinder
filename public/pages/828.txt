trivia frank capra went into production without a clear idea of how the film should end. he shot or edited five endings and previewed two. in one, the film ended with john being disgraced at the john doe convention and henry connell saying, "well, boys, you can chalk another one up to the pontius pilates." preview audiences found that version too depressing. another ending actually had john committing suicide, with the colonel cradling his dead body in his arms and saying, "long john, you poor fool. you poor sucker." robert riskin preferred this ending, but capra was unconvinced and feared the suicide would cause problems with the catholic church. he also had a version in which ann talks john out of committing suicide and a variation in which john's merry christmas with henry causes the corrupt publisher to see the light. undecided, capra released different versions of the ending for the film's initial engagements in los angeles, san francisco and washington, dc. finally, a comment from one of the previews inspired a fifth ending, in which some of the original john doe club members show up to tell willoughby they had never stopped believing in him. that also would allow capra to deal with another problem pointed out by preview audiences and in letters from angry fans--the depiction of willoughby's followers as a fickle herd easily swayed by the film's corrupt politicians. capra shot the new ending and had prints called back from theaters so it could be added before the film went into national release. years later he would say that even that ending wasn't quite right. see more &raquo; goofs when henry is telling john about morton's plans for the john doe clubs, he lights a match but holds it an inch above the cigarette that he suppose to light it with. at the end of the scene, henry presses the end of the cigarette into a plate to extinguish it, but the cigarette at this point is no longer burning and the end is already bent over showing that it had already been pressed into the plate in an early take. see more &raquo; quotes beany: what's a helot?
