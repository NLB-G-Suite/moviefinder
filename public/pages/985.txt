is not it. this is a family film for elementary school kids. i watched this movie for the first time when i was nine, and i absolutely loved it. i loved cheering for the underdog, and from my nine-year-old point of view, all the events were realistic and all the characters were believable. i especially loved larry, who was hilarious in his delusions. i watched this film again tonight and realize that it is a clich&eacute;d film, but only because i&#39;m much older and more cynical. however, this does not take away the fact that it brought back the days when i resolutely believed that the harder i worked, the more it would pay off and that anybody could be a winner. it is optimistic, heart-warming and uplifting for that inner nine-year-old. 3 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
