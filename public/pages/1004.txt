see all my reviews john malkovich gives a ground breaking performance as cyrus the virus in this movie and you won&#39;t find a similar performance anywhere else. he and john cusak actually overshadow nicholas cage for the most part of this movie. this movie is just filled with so many things that will keep you entertained and amused from start to finish, leave you extremely satisfied and force you to come back and watch the movie all over again. you also wont find such a huge assembly of stars in most other movies either. the same guys wont shy to display their attitudes as well. the story is good and the action is even better. the cinematography and screenplay are also top notch. this movie was a box office hit and i can&#39;t understand why its rated so low? 34 of 45 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
