trivia the film was made prior to actress jane fonda's "politicization" and maturation and evolution of her political persona. fonda then had to defend the film in the context of her future political views and simply accepted it despite the obvious "sex symbol" nature of the barbarella character, which feminists argued exploited women. see more &raquo; goofs during the opening sequence, as barbarella's face is revealed, a camera is reflected in the front of her helmet. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] videophone: stand by for a message from dianthus, president of earth and rotating premier of the sun system. see more &raquo; crazy credits in the opening credits, the letters in the words move around in an attempt to obscure barbarella's nudity. see more &raquo; connections referenced in kolle - ein leben f&uuml;r liebe und sex&nbsp;(2002) see more &raquo; soundtracks love theme from 'barbarella' written by bob crewe &amp; charles fox performed by the glitterhouse see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: was barbarella a virgin before meeting the fur trapper?
