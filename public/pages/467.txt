quotes the president: few of us are given the opportunity, even fewer the courage to sacrifice ourselves for the lives of our comrades. in daily life, even as in battle each one of us is mysteriously and irrevocably bound to our fellow man. and yet, it is only in death that the power of this bond is finally tested and proven. and who among us really knows how he might respond when the moment comes? see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; a desert storm-era update of &quot;rashomon&quot; 21 february 2005 | by philoso4 (alexandria, va (usa)) &ndash; see all my reviews a desert storm veteran, lt col nat serling (played by denzel washington), is assigned the task of recommending whether or not to award the first (posthumous) combat medal of honor to a woman, capt karen walden (played by meg ryan). in investigating the inconsistent mission accounts of walden's surviving crew, serling constantly flashes back to his own searing desert storm experience and the army's subsequent attempts to whitewash the incident, resolving that his investigation will not suffer the same fate. as serling tries to rectify the competing competing accounts it becomes clear that director edward zwick has crafted a contemporary &quot;rashomon,&quot; complete with reminders that the truth is always subjective and our accounts of it typically affected by self-interest. 19 of 25 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 108 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
