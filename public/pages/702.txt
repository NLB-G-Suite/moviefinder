"when i came in, i didn't know who 'savage' steve was at first," dozier told moviefone. "i [looked at one guy and] said, 'who's this chubby kid?' turns out, he's the director." holland remembers dozier interrupting him as he watched the dailies. "all of a sudden this pompous jerk comes in and says, 'hey, who's the fat surfer?' and i'm like, 'wow, who is this?' and they go, 'savage, this is the guy coming in for roy stalin.' and i'm like, 'you have the part! you're perfect.'" see more &raquo; goofs when lane's father is reading the book on teenage drug use, the camera focuses in on the headline of the chapter: &quot;paranoia&quot;. the first two lines of the chapter are visible &amp; are obviously &quot;greeked&quot; or made-up nonsense text. see more &raquo; quotes charles de mar: wait, wait a minute...
