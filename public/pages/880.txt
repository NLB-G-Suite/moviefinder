trivia robin shou (liu kang) and talisa soto (kitana) are the only actors from the first film to reprise their roles. the other main characters are portrayed by different actors. the only other actor to return was keith cooke, but as a different character. in the first film, he was reptile. here, he portrays sub-zero. see more &raquo; goofs during the first scene of the movie, rayden's hair starts out long, then is tied in a pony tail when he's fighting shao kahn, then his hair is let down again. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] rayden: [narrating] mortal kombat is not about death, but rather the preservation of life. liu kang and a few chosen fighters from the earth realm defeated outworld sorcerer shang tsung. according to the rules of mortal kombat, their victory preserved the safety of the earth for one more generation. our chosen ones were returned to liu kang's home on earth, only to enjoy a brief period of peace... for someone from outworld has a different point of view. see more &raquo; crazy credits out of respect for the people of thailand, this motion picture contains no depictions of harm to any sacred thai structures or simulations thereof. see more &raquo; connections featured in honest game trailers: mortal kombat&nbsp;(2014) see more &raquo; soundtracks 9d galactic center written by lupie and vas kallas performed by hanzel und gretyl courtesy of energy records see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: did mk: annihilation have an open ending like mk1?

baraka, mileena, sheeva, ermac, nightwolf, jade etc. are high profile fighters in the game, but in this movie, they were represented horribly. sheeva died without a fight, nightwolf came in just to hit an axe on liu kang, jade was just a traitor.shao kahn's acting was the worst. his fighting style lacked the depth and originality like shang tsung had in the previous film.all in all, i would recommend the fans of mortal kombat to avoid watching this movie if they want to maintain their good impression of the first movie. 28 of 36 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
