see all my reviews the ruling class is a disturbing commentary on the nature and necessity of our whole belief systems. it both highlights the extreme fragility of those beliefs, and takes gently mocking aim at us for our dependency on them. viewed in that light, the film succeeds 100%. when viewed merely as a satire on the british ruling classes, of course it doesn't. it goes far deeper, becoming also an essay on our tendency to manipulate others for our own benefit: the characters' collective idiosyncrasies serve as punctuation for that essay. brilliantly acted, often hilarious but always profoundly moving, it is a genuine classic of its kind, notwithstanding its undeniable, though relatively minor, flaws. i'd love to have it on dvd! 22 of 25 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
