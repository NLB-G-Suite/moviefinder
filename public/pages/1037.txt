8 november 2005 | by j-w-andrews (united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews the calibre of the actors is not in question but what they did with the material was nothing short of a miracle. as actors you have to make a living so please don't blame them, although i would say that the one that didn't fit was kevin pollack. he gave no reason for us to either empathise or sympathise with his character. jennifer tilly stole the show in this instance but i will have to admit her daughter played by jennifer love hewitt showed signs that her acting ability in comedic roles suits her better than he more serious roles she has been given. admittedly she doesn't have a gutsy enough part for the film. in fact the characters were all too shallow to be taken seriously in any respect although the storyline was entertaining there is no real depth to it. the film needed more background to each of the families involved to succeed. as it happened the only redemption was jenifer tilly whom not seen until almost all the parents were kidnapped, made the best of a bad situation and became a catalyst for the the other characters to play off of. verdict: most of the actors made the best of a bad script. but not a bad film i felt the director could have done better. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
