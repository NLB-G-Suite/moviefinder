see all my reviews it's been a few years coming, but not since 'under siege' has steven seagal easily fitted into his role. 'fire down below' marks the beginning of a successful change of focus for mr seagal. gone are the bone breaking fatal blows that really are not what aikido is about anyway. the martial art scenes are done with speed and precision as always but are not over the top. after all, mr. seagal is a 7th dan black belt aikidoist. [martial art freaks who want blood and guts can go and watch 'mortal combat'.] the mine scene was a bit disappointing, a little unbelievable, but i did say this was the beginning of a change of focus. gone is the basic seagal signature type 'here comes the hero' music. sound track is great - and yes he writes his own music and yes he can play the guitar. the scenery was great and cast, well it's as if they radiated kentucky - i could feel it and i'm from australia. i would have liked a little more passion at the end. mr. seagal seems a little ill at ease, but it may be a reflection of his own uneasiness with commitment, who wouldn't be after three marriages. all in all i liked it very much. i look forward to 'the patriot' and 'blood on the moon'. 18 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 109 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: earl kellogg orin hanner jr. orin hanner sr. cotton harry reverend bob goodall hatch sims edie carr phil pratt fbi agent #2 walter carr mrs. carr ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
