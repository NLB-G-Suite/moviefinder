trivia the murders at the beginning of the film evoke the 1959 murders of kansas farmer herb clutter, his wife and their two teenage children. this case was later documented in truman capote's book "in cold blood", which in turn was made into a film (in cold blood (1967)) starring scott wilson and robert blake as the two killers. wilson appears in this film in the role of arliss' employee. see more &raquo; goofs when roy is shot in the heart at the end of the film, a small circle of blood forms around the bullet hole in his shirt. later, when the body is shown again, the blood stain hasn't expanded in size. a real shot to the heart would have caused massive bleeding in a very short time, resulting in a greatly enlarged blood stain. see more &raquo; quotes waitress: unless that little pastry inside comes with a bicycle pump and two sisters, there ain't gonna be a farm animal safe for three counties tonight. see more &raquo; connections featured in hollywood's leading ladies with david sheehan&nbsp;(1993) see more &raquo; soundtracks bad to the bone written by george thorogood performed by george thorogood & the destroyers courtesy of emi records group/emi records under license from cema special markets see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; a classic film noir 17 june 2007 | by rbirge-1 (coventry, ct, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews you will never see meg ryan in a role like this. she was phenomenal and it is unfortunate she did not get more roles like this. dennis quaid and gwyneth paltrow were also excellent and these three make the film worth watching. james caan is fine, but his role is so one- dimensional that no actor can do much with it, and indeed he didn&#39;t.this film is a must see because of the characters. the plot is compelling and very dark, but the characters shine through and illuminate each other in a way that is unique because each character has dimensions that are not explained. paltrow&#39;s character seems like a throwaway, but may be the most important of all. if i were teaching a course on film, i would select this one and ask the students to explain why it works. i usually think i know why a film is excellent, and yet after this film ended, i knew i could not put it into words. the purpose of this review is to suggest you watch this one if you get a chance because you may love it. most who watched this movie were pleased but unenthusiastic. this film is much, much better than the 6.2 rating it had when i checked. 8 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
