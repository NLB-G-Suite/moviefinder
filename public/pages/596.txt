would lisa be conspicuously waving at jeff while stella (thelma ritter) was digging up the garden? moreover, wouldn't lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape? this film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from hitchcock films. though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.the acting is superb in this film. jimmy stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character. photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and stewart adopts this mindset perfectly. grace kelly has often been accused of being the `ice maiden' in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless. though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious. i always enjoy thelma ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best. raymond burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines. yet, he imbues thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.this film was rated number 42 on afi's top 100 of the century sandwiched between `psycho' (#18) and `vertigo' (#61). i personally think more highly of `vertigo' but it is a minor distinction, because i rated them both 10/10. `rear window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense. 62 of 77 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
