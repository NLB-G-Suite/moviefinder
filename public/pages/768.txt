frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews well acted, superbly directed and slightly flawed 31 august 1999 | by millennia-2 (in shame (2005 update)) &ndash; see all my reviews after reading nothing but negative reviews for three wishes all my expectations were crushed, but i watched it anyway. it was an excellent, perfectly acted (in most cases), well directed film with beautiful camera work. mary elizabeth mastrantonio plays a single mother of two whose husband supposedly died in korea (it takes place in the fifties). she invites a mysterious stranger who she hit with her car (causing a broken leg) to stay with them until his cast is taken off, with no idea on how he will change their lives forever.in his movies, patrick swayze is either good or horrendous. in this one he is both. at some points it looks like he'll get an oscar, at others, a golden raspberry. the underrated mary elizabeth mastrantonio (the abyss, limbo) is very good in her role, but the best performance belongs to joseph mazzello, who plays her oldest son, tom. despite being third billed, mazzello probably has the most screen time, and should've got some kind of award for his performance (though he wasn't as good her as he was in the cure). the other two leads were good. in his first film seth mumy plays mastrantonio's youngest son, and is given very few scenes with the rest of the family, spending most of his time with swayze's dog, who i'll go to now. the dog is completely adorable and happens to be a very good actor, even though he/she is a dog.without revealing anything, i'll say that the ending was completely unexpected, in a bad way. it was stupid, full of holes, unnecessary and made the director look like she (i think) had run out of ideas. michael o'keefe plays tom in 1995. he is so unbelievably awful, he almost bring the whole picture down with him. it would've been better if the narration had been left out. sadly, three wishes was one of the box office disasters that destroyed rysher entertainment. (who had my favorite logo for a production company. bad reason)+ (good things) 1.) camera work 2.) the promising cast 3.) the adorableness (is that a real word?) of the dog 4.) joseph mazzello's performance 5.) mary elizabeth mastrantonio's performance 6.) direction 7.) the script(bad things)1.) the ending 2.) flashback narrationtotal: 8.5/10 6 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 30 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: jeanne holman phil coach schramka adult tom leland's dad joyce little leland brian scott sackin brian's father scott's father ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
