edit did you know? trivia barry gray originally wrote the script as its own original action picture entitled "no turning back," whose lead was a black marine returning home from the persian gulf. but when phillip rhee got a hold of the script, he liked it so much that not only did he produce it, he wanted it to become a new entry in the best of the best (1989) series. so he asked deborah scott to rewrite it with tommy lee as the main character. see more &raquo;

user reviews worth seeing for the martial arts 12 august 1999 | by willie-42 (fairfax, virginia) &ndash; see all my reviews tommy lee (phillip rhee), comes into town to visit his sister karen, right after the mysterious disappearance of a black reverend. his chinese-american sister is married to a white sheriff, one of the few lawmen in this small southern town. as it turns out, a super-rascist skinhead cult is taking control of the town. it was a little ridiculous, as they had a huge compound with plenty of c-4 explosives and grenade launchers which would surely attract the attention of the fbi and atf. the sheriff and tommy lee take the law into their own hands, and it is up to one martial arts superhero to save the day. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
