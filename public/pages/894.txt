(maybe to reject my desire at this age to be free to disguise myself, like ludovic did in the movie). what i know is that being in a place that was supposed to gather cultivated people, journalists and movie reviewers, cinema lovers, artists, etc. i was chocked to hear people laughing at some scenes that were supposed to be moving, sensitive and very important humanely. also the sound going out public mouth: &quot;tsss tsss tsss&quot; was so chocking that i felt more the pressure of &quot;non-tolerant&#39; society inside the movie theater itself, more than the pressure ludovic had to endure in his story. my personality was projected into ludovic who suffered his moments in the film, while i was personally suffering inside the theater and trying to vibe with the movie, despite chocked snobbish people&#39;s reaction. an excellent movie. rather a drama than a comedy! 13 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 68 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: Élisabeth albert lisette thierry monique psychoanalyst pam sophie ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
