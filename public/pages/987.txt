(nathaniel)`i'm sorry, i was just thinking how much fun it is to roast pumpkin seeds.' (nathaniel)`gum.' (kenny)`would you like to buy a monkey?' (dave)`well. thanks for that. whatever that was.' (nathaniel)`i'm drawn to you, even though you have the breeding of a carnival barker.' (nathaniel)`i just don't get it! she seems totally uninterested in me, despite my smothering obsessiveness!' (nathaniel)`oddly enough, it kind of tastes like marzipan!' (nathaniel)nathaniel: `i love sitting up here, looking at those bright, twinkly things in the sky, i forget their technical name.' trina: `stars.' nathaniel: `whatever.'how can anyone not love these lines? ah, diff'rent strokes, i guess. another favorite scene of mine is when &quot;cappy&quot; goes to sleep nestled up to chris and they wake up in each other's arms the following morning. just the expression on chris' face while sleeping is so glorious.all the complaints i've seen about elliot's demeanor indicate to me that people have completely missed the point. they talk about how annoying and whiny he is, but that's the whole point of his character in this film: a rich snotty kid who is forced to endure the antics of those from the less privileged caste (but who are no less intellectually challenged, natch).i typically don't like comedy movies, because they're just way too formulaic and rigid--i tend to prefer sketch comedy or stand-up/improvisation. but with this movie, i can't stop laughing. i'm always eager to see where chris elliot will pop up next, and sadly it's been too long. but as nathaniel one said to chocky, &quot;i shan't forget you!&quot; 12 of 13 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 92 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
