see all my reviews much preferable to klapisch's follow-up, the stagebound un air de famille, this film still visualises the traumatic labyrinth of its heroine as she tries to escape her diffident personality, her rotten luck with men and the bewildering changes to her beloved paris. klapisch isn't above using his cat metaphor scatalogically as well as philosophically, but the detective search for enlightenment gives the plot a badly needed momentum the second film lacks. rohmeresque, it's been called, and you can see the point in the reliance on dialogue, young protagonists, irony and colour-coding, if not the elder's overarching critical intelligence. chacun achieves an empathy with its heroine the master might envy. 3 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
