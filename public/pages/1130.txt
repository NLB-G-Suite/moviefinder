trivia nick nolte and louis gosset jr. played together in the deep 1977. see more &raquo; goofs after the losing season at the start of the movie, coach bell travels to see butch play a high school game. the college season outlasts the high school season by weeks to months. there is no chance that butch&#39;s team is playing a home game after the college&#39;s regular season is over. there is a small chance that the coach could have gone to a state tournament game to see butch play, but even those tournaments are over before the college season ends. in addition, most high school players have signed a letter of intent early in their senior year making a recruiting trip in the early spring unrealistic. it is understandable from a pacing perspective why the film was shot this way. the coach has another losing season and decides not to let it happen again and goes after the blue chip players to be better next year. in the real world, he would have been making the recruiting trips (or his assistant coaches would have) much earlier, during the season and not after it. see more &raquo; quotes pete bell: ...but goddamnit, those kids played out their heart. they gave everything they had! they played up to the *maximum* of their ability! they gave it everything. and you know, it wasn't good enough. it wasn't good enough for me, wasn't good enough for you, wasn't good enough for anybody! see more &raquo; connections referenced in sports jeopardy!: episode #2.40&nbsp;(2016) see more &raquo; soundtracks when i first came to this land by oscar brand see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; another underrated movie, a great film 16 october 2000 | by apursansar (columbus) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie is very underrated, it hasn't gotten nearly the credit it deserves. i thought it was very well done, although it wasn't perfect, it was still very good. it is the first movie to talk about a problem that is very prominent in todays colleges and their methods of recruiting. the film is very well written and nick nolte does a great, great job playing the conflicted coach. 4 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
