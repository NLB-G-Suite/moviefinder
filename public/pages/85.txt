(merchant-ivory productions are always no. 1 on my list of movies), they are very sophisticated and mature in any sense, the actors as well as the production/movie itself) the title is very appropriate for the movie (you will see it once you watch the movie and get to the end) i have seen this movie at least 20 times and could watch it over and over again. some might consider it a bit &quot;slow&quot;, but that is the beauty of it, the music and the scenery are also &quot;mind-blowing&quot;. cannot compare this to a shallow typical &quot;hollywood movie&quot;, this is a high-class movie of the best kind! 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see one user review&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
