sharon can 'strut their stuff' in the coupling dept. sharon vamps, sly warbles thru his lines. yea, he's got a deep &amp; sexy voice but you can only pick up on what he's saying to her on the phone if you got close-caption on your set! anyway, they both look very fine in this film. james woods is the pest you'll love to hate being the back-stabber that he is. &quot;slime&quot; is the only word to use for eric roberts role &amp; rod steiger's hispanic accent is fun! see the edited version of this one. it's got a slick color to it that's quite appealing being that it was shot in miami where everything's bright pink &amp;
