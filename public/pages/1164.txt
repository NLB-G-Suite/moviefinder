frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews you might like it, you might not 16 september 2008 | by ichocolat (i1chocolat.blogspot.com) &ndash; see all my reviews there are some films that you can&#39;t decide whether the film is good or bad. on whether the film is worth the watch or you&#39;re better off doing some other more meaningful things. this film is one of it.as i said, you might like it, you might not.the acting a little bit over the top, but i think that&#39;s what the producer intended to do. the jokes may at times be quite crude, but maybe it&#39;s exactly the way it was suppose to be.worth a mention here is jada pinkett acting. she&#39;s quite good ! and i like her hairstyle too. not that it has any bearing of the quality of acting though, just wanted to let you guys know.over all, the film is nice to watch, if you don&#39;t take it seriously. 4 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
