trivia the film was inspired by steven soderbergh's own failed relationship. "i drove the most important woman in my life to leave because i didn't want to be in the relationship but couldn't just say, 'i don't want to be in this,'" soderbergh told film comment. "so i was very deceptive about how i got out of it. and then once i was out of it, i couldn't even allow it the dignity to die properly. i kept stringing it out and not letting it go and then i got involved with some other people." after, soderbergh was able to reconnect with that person; "we were able to be friends," he noted. see more &raquo; goofs in most videos, the camera moves constantly during the interviews, as if hand-held. in almost every interview we see, graham sets the camera down before starting their discussions. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] ann: garbage. all i've been thinking about all week is garbage. i mean, i just can't stop thinking about it. see more &raquo; crazy credits this film is dedicated to ann dollard 1956-1988 see more &raquo; connections referenced in la tarea&nbsp;(1991) see more &raquo; soundtracks garbage written by mark a. mangini performed by mark a. mangini see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews iced-tea, anyone? 14 august 2002 | by lee-107 (leewhys@gmail.com) (india) &ndash; see all my reviews why does graham prefer iced tea so much? he offers it to ann when she visits him for the first time at his apartment. does the same when cynthia pays him a visit. when he and ann are having their first real conversation in the restaurant there's a glass of iced tea next to him, while ann has a glass of white wine. besides being a probable leitmotif, it's something that, seems to me is a part of graham's character. he comes to live in that town to get away, to find a closure to his past. he ends up providing closure to the lives of these three characters. let's imagine a scenario sans graham - a phase in the life of a woman whose husband is having an extra-marital affair with her sister. she's suspicious but he denies. she finds evidence to prove that he's having an affair with her sister and decides she's had it, she's leaving her husband. do you think this might have been the conclusion of this scenario? i think not. as ann rightly says to graham, that she would have left her husband anyway, but the reason she's doing it now, is because of him. she thinks sex is overrated, her sister seems to believe in the opposite and here comes a man whose profession, for all practical purposes is having women talk about sex. ann's therapist is a foil to graham. while he dispenses his advice and listens patiently to ann, graham is the all important catalyst that helps her make a practical decision in her life. he also aids in her real sexual awakening. before graham, sex, for ann was incidental. now it takes on a different perspective. one might say that in making women talk so intimately to him about sex, he sort of breaks the ice on a topic that is more or less socially tabooed. his is a presence that evokes trust in the most introverted of women, making them confide in him and by doing so have an almost cathartic experience. i think the iced tea motif of graham's character fits in here. beyond his trademark black-shirt, blue denim attire, it is the only other element related to him that is conspicuously stated. that's my conjecture anyway! needless to say, james spader is superb as graham. he manages to evoke many of the nuances of graham's character by subtle, volatile facial expressions. andie mcdowell is also great as ann. hers is a really sensitive and touching performance. peter gallagher and laura san giacomo are both equally good. the music for this film is appropriately minimal and poignant. great effort by soderbergh, who i'm glad to hear has come back to his experimental film roots with his recent film 'full frontal'. 29 of 47 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 97 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: landlord john's colleague ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
