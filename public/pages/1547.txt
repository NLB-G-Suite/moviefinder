see all my reviews i will echo a comment that someone made about -the big lebowski- (my #1 favorite comedy followed by this delightful mess). &quot;warning: this film transmits on a strictly limited wavelength.&quot; if you don&#39;t catch this curveball, you&#39;re likely to be bored. i won&#39;t say that if you don&#39;t like it on first viewing, then you&#39;re never going to like it. in my case, certain movies get more enjoyable on repeat viewings even after receiving a ho-hum response the first time around. this is one of those movies. with a narrative more fractured than your average david lynch film, there are connections between one scene and another that jump out and take notice only on repeat viewings, sort of like &quot;portals&quot; from one part of the movie to another. music that plays, pictures shown on the wall, one-sided phone conversations, that sort of thing. aside from the already-limited-wavelength humor, these amplify the laugh factor. this is a movie destined for some kind of limited cult-following someday, but keeping to a murmur level when you&#39;re standing next to an air conditioner. the criterion dvd has some good features and outtakes, like the &quot;maximum busy muscle&quot; segment extolling the virtues of all products vinyl.update nov. &#39;06. re-watching this almost on a whim, and it all comes together (such as it is) even more. this is truly hilarious, a comedy masterpiece reveling in all its many absurdities, which come one after the other at a highly accelerated rate. i&#39;m upping my vote from 9 to 10.&quot;you will learn something from me here today.&quot;
