(look for fergie the poodle and the wiener-wagon scene --- i laughed out loud!) suprisingly, there are some serious moments as well, and you may find yourself wiping away a tear. this is when you find your identification with the boys, and the movie becomes yet even more wonderful. all in all, this is my favorite movie because of the wonderfully warm and funny cast and the never-say-die attitude of the lewis brothers. don't miss it! 5 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 49 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: julian lewis jeremy lewis greyo mrs. mort mr. mort fatty lewis adie lewis jean lewis olive taxi driver dodgy tv presenter dai reese chip roberts ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
