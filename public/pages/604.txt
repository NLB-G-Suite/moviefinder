trivia the portrait of gene tierney as laura appeared in on the riviera (1951) (in color) co-starring danny kaye, then later in woman's world (1954) starring clifton webb, the frustrated waldo lydecker of "laura". in "woman's world" the painting hung on a wall amid portraits of several other women who were supposed to have been former romantic interests of webb's character. see more &raquo; goofs the clock, which is heard to strike the time, only has one keyhole on its face. however, because the striking mechanism is separate from the timekeeping mechanism, a chiming clock must have at least two separate keyholes - one for the clock itself, and one for the strike. presumably the prop was made only to keep the time since the production staff knew they would be adding the sound of the chime in post-production. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] waldo lydecker: [narrating off screen] i shall never forget the weekend laura died. a silver sun burned through the sky like a huge magnifying glass. it was the hottest sunday in my recollection. i felt as if i were the only human being left in new york. for with laura's horrible death, i was alone. i, waldo lydecker, was the only one who really knew her, and i had just begun to write laura's story when another of those detectives came to see me. i had him wait. i could watch him through the ...
