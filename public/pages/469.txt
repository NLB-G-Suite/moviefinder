trivia when centipede jumps on the icy waters in search for a compass, the puppet used for the captain of the ship is the same one used as jack skellington in the nightmare before christmas (1993), also directed by henry selick. centipede can also be heard asking, "a skellington?" as he enters the ship. see more &raquo; goofs at the start of the movie, the narrator states that a rhino appears out of nowhere and eats james' parents. the aunts bring up the rhino several times during the movie. it's later revealed that the rhino is just a bunch of smoke and noise, which makes no sense because that same rhino ate james' parents. perhaps the biggest error of all is the fact the whole thing with the rhino &quot;appearing out of nowhere&quot; is never explained. in the book, james' parents are eaten by a rhino that escaped from the london zoo while they were shopping at the market. the book explains it, whilst the movie does not. see more &raquo; quotes spider: we are in the middle of the, how do you say, the big puddle. centipede: biggest puddle of 'em all, angel fangs - the atlantic ocean. old green grasshopper: technically, the pacific is the biggest. centipede: well, that goes without saying. see more &raquo; crazy credits after the credits, there is some footage of a carnival game based on the story being played. see more &raquo; connections spoofed in american dad!: choosy wives choose smith&nbsp;(2008) see more &raquo; soundtracks sail away written and performed by noël coward courtesy of emi records ltd. by arrangement with emi special markets uk see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews a classic in my home 11 february 2002 | by dave wilson (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i really enjoyed it, and so did my 3- and 5-year-old (and yes, we read the book). the animation and live-action scenes showed a lot of love. though elements of the story seemed a bit hurried or neglected, they weren't anything a fairy-tale fantasy couldn't absorb in stride. the music works well enough for this non-fan of musicals, and i prefer serviceable and inoffensive tunes to the treacly jingles and melodramatic scores of the usual disney classics.my only real complaint would be with the ending, as it really is unclear how the aunts drove across the ocean (did they obtain their own crocodile tongues?), and the slice of ny upon landing has a grim, munchkin-town quality. still, everything up to that point has left you with lots of goodwill towards the movie's makers. 6 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
