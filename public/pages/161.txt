edit did you know? trivia the middle-eastern country of "lugash", in which parts of the movie takes place and which was described as being allied with france for 200 years, is most likely meant to represent algeria, which was once a french colony... though independent since 1962. this is not stated directly though, but a clue is found in the facts that lytton (christopher plummer) interact with a lugash customs officer who is brandishing a french accent. later he is also interacting with a local lugash bartender in french. the french language is still spoken by roughly 33% of the modern algerian population. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews out of all of the pink panther movies this one is my all time favorite.clouseau is at it again, bungling at his best. his boss who is on the edge for terminating him, indefinitely! and i don't mean by saying &quot;you're fired!&quot; i mean he's going to kill him! he called everyone aroud him &quot;idiots&quot; especially his assistant after he accidentally shoots off his nose. the fight scene between kato and clouseau was nothing more than mockery of the matial arts. other than that i enjoyed every part of the movie.10. case closed! 14 of 21 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
