but the fact it is is told backwards, headed by monthly chapters, makes it a little bit special. the film demands to be seen numerous times in this sense to grasp the nuances of the beginning which is really the end and contrast it with the end which is really the beginning. by flipping narrative convention on its head, canpion urges the viewer to be alert to what went wrong between the girls. it's a clever device that has inspired many film-makers, including a recent adherent, french auteur, francois ozon, whose latest release 5 x 2 follows the same narrative conceit but instead dramatizes the decline of a marriage. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
