edit did you know? trivia when irene, portrayed by carole lombard, and molly, portrayed by jean dixon, are sobbing in the kitchen, godfrey, portrayed by william powell, comes in, tipsy after his drinking bout with tommy, portrayed by alan mowbray. the lines of the song he sings are "for tomorrow may bring sorrow/ so tonight let's all be gay./ tell the story of the glory". these lines come from "drink a highball", a song of harvard's ivy league rival, university of pennsylvania. the lines continue "of pennsylvania." the writers likely cut it off to avoid the obvious contradiction of a harvard man singing a penn song, no matter how appropriate to his imbibing. see more &raquo; goofs when irene first goes into godfrey's room the door opens to the right, in the direction of the kitchen - revealing molly standing in the background. in the next shot the door is open on the left, in the direction of the bedroom. see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; the 1st movie oscar nominated in all 4 acting category. 4 june 2003 | by dcurry-1 (washington dc) &ndash; see all my reviews why it did not receive a best picture nomination is a mystery to me. this is an excellent screwball comedy with a sane &amp; socially conscious message. although the whole cast is flawless, i would give a slight edge to alice brady. she did not win the oscar in 36, but did win in 37 for &quot;in old chicago&quot;. she had one of the best lines in the movie when speaking to one of her daughters 'it took me all these years to realize insanity runs on your father's side'. eugene pallete is excellent as the father &amp; should also have been nominated. this is the only movie i can remember watching with carole lombard &amp; she illuminates the screen in every scence. a must! 10/10 32 of 37 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
