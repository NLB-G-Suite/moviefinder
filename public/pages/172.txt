wrong - archaeologists pronounce &quot;cist&quot; with a hard &quot;k&quot; sound at the beginning, whereas dr. jones pronounces it like &quot;cyst&quot; with a soft &quot;s&quot; sound. a genuine archaeologist who knew about the neolithic would not make this mistake. see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; my favorite movie of all time! 19 april 2001 | by aaron1375 &ndash; see all my reviews there are few movies i can watch over and over again, but this is one of them. this movie has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. harrison ford is at his best as dr. jones, one of the most exciting archeologist ever. from the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. i love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure, i love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl, i just love every bit of it. spielburg said he wanted a b-type movie like he remembered from his youth, but this far surpasses any b movie and any a movie as far as i am concerned. 93 of 156 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
