small but powerful movie 8 august 1999 | by gabriel stern (israel) &ndash; see all my reviews there is much to recommend in this small, well made and excellently acted movie. david arquette gives a wonderfully charismatic performance though at times almost parodying a young robert de niro. the film resembles &quot;midnight cowboy&quot; in its portrayal of friendship and support in the harsh world of street hustling and the dream of escaping to a better place. director scott silver elicits fine performance from all and manages to convey the atmosphere of los angeles street life. there are lapses here and there, but the overall effect makes this a film well worth watching. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
