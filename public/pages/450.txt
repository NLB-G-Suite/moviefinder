trivia ron eldard spent a lot of time playing sports with jena malone so they would both feel comfortable performing the scenes in which he is physically abusing her. he claimed that in no scene did inappropriate contact with malone take place, and that for scenes in which he appears to grab her by the throat, he is actually only holding her by his fingertips. eldard was adamant that the graphic depiction of sexual abuse and rape was a necessity for the film. see more &raquo; goofs (00:12:57) dermot mulroney's character (lyle parsons) is driving along a road past a modern looking house with a very modern looking red truck parked in the driveway. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] narrator: "people pay for what they do, and still more for what they allow themselves to become. and they pay for it simply; by the lives they lead." james baldwin. see more &raquo; soundtracks searching for someone like you written by murphy maddux (as murphy maddux jr.) performed by kitty wells see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what is glen actually doing to bone in the car?
