user reviews &nbsp; very good 3 june 2002 | by fukko123 (brum, england) &ndash; see all my reviews not sure why some people reviewing this come out with &quot;this movie was crap&quot; or this movie was worse than &quot;plan 9 from outer space&quot;i liked it and thought it had an exellent plot. i didnt think that they did too bad considering it was a tv movie. maybe a little too long, but worst movie ever? not really just certain people who disliked it a little didnt want to review this and say &quot; i disliked this movie a little.......erm&quot; the langoliers did also look pretty poor, but the build up to the langoliers was more important.very good and certainly not worst movie ever.have you people ever seen death wish 3 and 4 or titanic or hobgoblins? i can assure you that they are much worse. 39 of 59 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
