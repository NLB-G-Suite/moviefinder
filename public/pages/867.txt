trivia the parking garage that emily makes the phone call from is located on yates street in victoria, bc, canada. the bridge in the background is the johnson street bridge. see more &raquo; goofs at the end of the movie, when vincent closes the trunk of the cadillac deville with his leg, there is a distinctive latching sound of the trunk. cadillacs do not make such a sound since they have a motorized trunk-closing mechanism which closes the trunk silently when the deck lid is closed gently. it is impossible for a cadillac to make such a sound as the one in the movie (unless it was modified). see more &raquo; quotes vincent: i once stole a ferrari with a chihuahua in the back. he made less noise than you do. see more &raquo; crazy credits andy warhol's "double elvis" is a reproduction and not signed. see more &raquo; connections featured in beyond clueless&nbsp;(2014) see more &raquo; soundtracks one head light written by jakob dylan performed by the wallflowers courtesy of interscope records by arrangement with universal music special markets see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; pleasant, fun comedy, nothing more or less 17 september 2003 | by dedjim (alaska) &ndash; see all my reviews lots of dissing for both alicia and benicio but it seems disingenuous. this is not a profound film but it is a fun one. nice photography, a plot that has a good rhythm and tempo, engaging characters that are well acted and clever film devices (for one, the conflict regarding her smoking that set up the plot complication in the first place). walken is great as usual as a character both scary and endearing. spark a blunt, open a beer and enjoy this silly but fun little flick. 15 of 21 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
