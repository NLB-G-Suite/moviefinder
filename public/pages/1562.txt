frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews very unique 29 july 2004 | by darienwerfhorst (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i thought this was a very unique movie, with the same dry quirkiness as some other australian flicks of the 90s like muriel's wedding and priscilla.the two sisters live in such a tragic backwater that when a has-been dj comes to live in their town, they don't even realize what a loser he is.they are so desperate for a social life they both go after him, and the results are funny (and the ending unexpected.)if you don't appreciate the typically dry sense of humor of the brits and australians, you probably won't enjoy it, but if you do, it's a bit of a gem. 6 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
