trivia in one scene, billy and jo talk about travelling while lying back in the remains of a car. this short scene took an extremely long time to shoot, because of two tramps who refused to move from the area and who kept shouting at one another. once the tramps quietened down the crew had to contend with the deafening sound from a helicopter hovering above a nearby hospital. see more &raquo; quotes mrs. taylor: to monkey: where the fuck are you going?
