i think so. 6 may 1999 | by neil ferris (n.ferris@uea.ac.uk) (norwich, england) &ndash; see all my reviews this film is one of those rare gems, a sequel that is as good as, or even better than the original.christina ricci fulfills all the promise that she showed in the first film, as she really steals the film from her more established co-stars.the scenes at camp produce some of the best one-liners, and it is great to see an american film that is self-mocking about its image concious rich societies. lines from ricci like &quot; is that your overbite?&quot; and &quot;when they woke up all their old noses had grown back!&quot; are superb and will be much loved in the uk, as it is how much of the states is perceived over here.also, amanda in this movie, is also played by the same girl who played the girl scout in the first movie.add a little bit of romance between wednesday and another kid at the camp and you have something for everyone in this wonderfully funny and worryingly endearing movie. 29 of 36 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
