the movie is awesome! it's a fun movie with excellent special effects.some people have complained about the story...i don't get it, the story seemed fine to me, given the nature of the film. the movie is about tornados!!! it's not supposed to be a deep and thought-provoking film, it's just meant to be entertaining, and it most certainly does that!!! i thought the story was excellent and really kept you interested in what was going to happen next, the movie flows very nicely from scene to scene, from start to finish. also, i have to mention (before i forget) that i loved jo harding's (helen hunt's) group of storm chasers, they were a great bunch of interesting characters! i loved them all!!!the actors all did a fantastic job and there were a lot of them that are worth mentioning. bill paxton does an awesome job as always. helen hunt if fabulous, and looks just as beautiful as ever. jami gertz also did a fine job and looked fantastic. philip seymour hoffman did a really good job, this seems like such a different role for him and he nailed it! cary elwes is one of those few actors that can convincingly play a bad guy and a good guy and is also just as good in comedy films. he's a very talented actor and did a great job in this film. i won't mention all names, but all of the storm chasers did a great job with their roles. as for director, jan de bont: another great film to add to his resume! i can't wait to see his next film! and, i have to mention writers michael crichton and anne-marie martin as well, they both did a great job with the story!if you're looking for a fast-paced, energetic, interesting, fun movie with some killer special effects, then this is the movie for you! i would definitely recommend this film to just about anyone. there is rarely anything objectional in the film and i would imagine that this would appeal to a great deal of people. i definitely think you should see this film. i really hope you enjoy the film. thanks for reading.-chris 57 of 99 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
