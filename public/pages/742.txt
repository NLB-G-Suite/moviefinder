trivia sir anthony hopkins astounded the crew by delivering the entire seven page courtroom speech in a single take. steven spielberg was so in awe, he couldn't bring himself to call him tony, and insisted on addressing him as sir anthony throughout the shoot. see more &raquo; goofs when the africans are loading up on fresh water, an american ship cruises by with a long stream of water pouring from the side, presumably discharge from a pump or engine. the discharge is near the water line, it's not raining, and the sea is calm. even under those conditions, the water on deck would flow over the side, not form a long stream. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] ruiz: [to pedro montes] that one wants us to sail them back. that one thinks he can sail all the way back without us. see more &raquo; crazy credits the events depicted did not historically occur at fort el morro see more &raquo; connections referenced in newsradio: big brother&nbsp;(1998) see more &raquo; soundtracks i love thy kingdom, lord written by aaron williams lyrics by timothy dwight (uncredited) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how accurate is the movie?

though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. despite his detractors, spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.highly recommended. 40 of 44 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
