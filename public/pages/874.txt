and a clever mix between an old and new performance of &#x22;like a hurricane&#x22; that was very good. with that said, the ugliness of the film also has some pretty boring interviews where young and the band just keep talking and talking and quite often it&#x27;s about a rather uninteresting subject. there&#x27;s no question that young die hards will want to check this out but others should probably avoid it. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
