we see each character for what they are, and each actor is allowed to show us why they are so famous. i believe this film to be a landmark piece of cinema for this generation. as much as 12 angry men was in its own time. how often do you see such a cast get together with such a fine script? not often enough, i&#39;d say.the kevin spacey character has a special place in my heart. i also work at a job where i have to deal with a bunch of pompous salesmen. i suppose it comes with the job, but salesmen always seem to think they are more important than they are. what they don&#39;t seem to understand is that different people can be hired to sell the same goods and services. more often than not, it is the company that retains or loses customers. that said, sales is a ballsy profession, and it does take genuine skill and luck to be successful at it.for those out there who either are salesmen or like them, then this film will also be a treat. there is one beautiful scene in particular when jack lemmon has just made what he thinks is a huge sale to break his slump. he bursts into the office and happily demands his sale be noted on the board with everyone else&#39;s. nobody but pacino seems interested (harris for example acts jealous and spiteful) in hearing the details. pacino comes over and sits by lemmon and listens to how the old master was able to pull it off. the camera subtly backs off and lets the two share the moment together. that was very well-done.due to all the profanity in this film, it is basically not possible to show it on network television. this may be the primary reason the film has slipped through the cracks over the years, and not made many top 100 lists and so forth. if you want to see some great actors doing what they do best, then do not miss this film! 10 of 10 stars the hound. 84 of 97 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
