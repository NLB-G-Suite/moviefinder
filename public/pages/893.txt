16 january 1999 | by del-6 (california, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews afterglow is one of the best films of 1997. julie christie has been away too long. with the exception of her role as gertrude in the 1996 version of hamlet, i can't recall such a performance in years, and she radiates pure magic in this one. nick nolte is always at his best in the smaller, independent films and his portrayal in afterglow is nothing short of brilliant. so, why isn't it available on laserdisc or dvd?
