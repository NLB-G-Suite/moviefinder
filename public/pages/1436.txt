good movie 28 january 2011 | by jvfunn1 (zephyrhills fl) &ndash; see all my reviews i saw tom and huck about 15 years ago and i must say it was a pretty good movie. the plot was pretty good about two boys named tom sawyer and hucklberry finn who go out to find a murder named injun joe who murdered the doctor of their town and framed their friend muff potter for the crime. the movie was just really great and had a lot of funny scenes in it including the scene where tom and huck disguise themselves in mud to hide from injun joe. jonathan taylor thomas, whom i think is one of the most gifted child actors ever did a fantastic job playing tom sawyer and the late brad renfro did a fantastic job as huck finn. both actors bought good performances to their characters and child actress rachael leigh cook i thought did a good job as tom&#x27;s love interest becky thatcher. and actor eric schweig i thought gave a good performance as the villainous injun joe. disney couldn&#x27;t of cast a better actor to play the role. i say that tom and huck is a great disney movie that the whole family must see. i give it a 10 out of 10. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
