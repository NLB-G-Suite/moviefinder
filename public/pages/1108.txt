user reviews elizabeth taylor stands out in a downbeat, though generally well-crafted, drama 17 january 2006 | by snow leopard (ohio) &ndash; see all my reviews though downbeat and sometimes sad, this is a generally well-crafted human drama that explores several aspects of family life and relationships. elizabeth taylor is the standout in a good cast, with van johnson also getting some good scenes. the postwar paris setting is used in a number of well-conceived ways in the story.johnson plays the main character, a reporter and would-be novelist who begins the movie with a trip back to paris, and begins reminiscing about the past. the character's career disappointments and family crises give much of the story a markedly pessimistic (if not depressing) tone, yet johnson plays the part believably, and the story brings out some worthwhile thoughts, as his character gradually loses his perspective on things.as his wife, taylor's appeal and energy stand out every time she is on screen, but more importantly, she develops the character consistently throughout the story, often in interesting contrast to johnson's character. she starts out as a rather spoiled, fun-loving young woman, then gradually takes on more depth and character. her performance adds considerable meaning to the rest of the movie, and it also help in making the other characters more believable.walter_pidgeon (sorry, otherwise can't get it past the spell-checker) seems to be having fun as the easygoing father, and donna reed does a solid job in a rather thankless role as taylor's more serious, sometimes envious sister. eva gabor and a young roger moore play characters who are one-dimensional yet important to the plot.overall, everything works pretty well. the pace is just a bit slow at times, which occasionally makes for heavy going during the sadder stretches. but these always have a point, and as a whole it is a worthwhile drama with some interesting characters. 12 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
