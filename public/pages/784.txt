frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; intelligence and humour 2 october 2004 | by valadas (portugal) &ndash; see all my reviews woody allen is a genius indeed. once more in this movie he presents us with a mixture of intelligence and humour conveyed by his famous witty dialogues where the characters seem to play with serious things but are indeed giving us through humour an image of what people think and feel about life nowadays and about the relationships that spring among them. this story mix up with considerable success two ingredients that &quot;a priori&quot; seem not to combine very well: the world of theatre with the world of mafia and gangsterism in the crazy twenties of last century. all the characters are very typical and greatly performed: the young playwright looking for a place in the sun, the ham actress who overacts a lot even in real life, the mafia boss who imposes his girlfriend on the playwright as an actress, the greenwich village intellectuals and so on. in my opinion however the feeblest character is the one of the gangster who becomes also playwright from a certain moment on. some of his interventions lack authenticity. but this is only a minor flaw in the whole. like all the other woody allen's movies this one seems superficial at first sight but it's well made and deep enough to amuse us and simultaneously make us think and feel life in it. 15 of 17 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
