an admirable film 26 february 2000 | by dylan (liverpool, uk) &ndash; see all my reviews you can see how passionate about the subject the writers rose troche and the fabulously talented guinevere turner were about making this movie and it must have been a labour of love for them.i don't think this movie is just for gay women, i'm a straight man who enjoyed it too so it must have worked on a lot of levels. i thought it was a beautiful film with a lot to say and was very well shot. it made me a big fan of guinevere turner, i just watched preaching to the perverted with her in the lead role last night which i also enjoyed immensley...she has a lot of talent and obviously chooses her roles selectively.it is an arty film which i think some people may watch with the wrong intentions...they will be disappointed but so what...they're not the people the writers intended the movie for. 6 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
