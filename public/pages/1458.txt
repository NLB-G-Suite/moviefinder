user reviews not a bad movie for a wrestler and an exercise guru 2 september 1999 | by ron hicks (lewisville, north carolina) &ndash; see all my reviews i caught this movie on cable today and was fairly impressed. not with the action or special effects, but how well piper and banks played off of each other. piper was more believable in his character than banks, but banks held his own. the action was ok, but nothing to get excited about. this actually turned out to be a really good buddy movie with a good mix of action, drama and a fair mix of humor. this is one that is worth watching just for the heck of it. remember...it's not an a movie...it's a b movie at best. 4 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
