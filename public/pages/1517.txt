see all my reviews this film is about a mother of seven sons, who had a premonition dream about something bad will happen to one of her sons. as their family learns about the tragedy, they come together and learn to love each other again.&#x22;safe passage&#x22; is a drama about real people, real family and real life situations. the characters are down to earth and authentic. they could our next door neighbours or even ourselves. hence, i find myself connecting with the characters and the story of &#x22;safe passage&#x22;.susan sarandon is superb as a stressed out mother. she acts her character&#x27;s emotions well, be it love, stress, anxiety, guilt or anger. i like the flashbacks and the home videos, as they provide further insight into how the past shaped the character&#x27;s personality. &#x22;safe passage&#x22; is an engaging drama. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 10 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo;
