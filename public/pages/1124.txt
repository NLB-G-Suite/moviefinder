because in my opinion it's still a great cult classic. it gives a very good image about how people thought about computers a few years ago when not everybody had one yet. the handlenames are mysterious (&quot;acid burn&quot; &quot;the plaque&quot;) but would be ridiculous in this age. people are overjoyed when they get to see a 28.8 bps modem (who needs t3 anyway? ;) plus they pretend as if you can see a program running like it's some sort of great graphic animation. angelina jolie and jonny lee miller (from trainspotting) are really great in this movie although you can see they're still pretty young and unexperienced. 9/10 41 of 68 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
