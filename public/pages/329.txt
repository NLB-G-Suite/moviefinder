user reviews &nbsp; my favorite movie of all times and not for the obvious reasons. 29 january 2009 | by kbright (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i first saw this on vhs tape when it first came out. it was not in theaters long enough for word of mouth to drive a wave of references. this was the only movie i ever had to immediately rewind, gather the family and watch it again that night. do not watch on tv where it is has been cut for time. what i liked about this film is that every frame and every scene was important to the story. there are no puppy in the window filler shots. i applaud the writing and the directing for such an intricate weaving of &quot;the game&quot; concept. not a film for those with no patience or interest in covert operations. i now enjoy watching others watch this film as they start to recognize things and try to figure out what is going on, only to be wrong several times. i see something new every time i watch it. brilliant concept and execution of the concept on film. 46 of 59 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
