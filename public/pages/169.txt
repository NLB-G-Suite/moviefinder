trivia many elements of cause/consequence make the film ever more interesting to watch again and again. one such example is a couple always using the same prophylactic (a condom), of which the husband (ticky olgado) takes great care: it has been patched twice. hence, the couple has two kids. see more &raquo; goofs when julie first invites louison to her house, she accidentally throws a vase to the floor. there is no &quot;crash&quot; sound when the vase is destroyed. see more &raquo; quotes louison: dr livingstone... he was my partner. julie clapet: where is he now? louison: he disappeared one night, after a show. we only found his remains... they ate him! can you believe that? they ate him! see more &raquo; connections references le corbeau&nbsp;(1943) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: odd instrument?
