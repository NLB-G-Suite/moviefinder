trivia david o. selznick wanted much of the film to be based on his experiences in psychotherapy. he even brought his psychotherapist in on the set to be a technical advisor. once, when she disputed with alfred hitchcock on the workings of therapy, hitchcock responded, "my dear, it's only a movie." see more &raquo; goofs when john ballantine, after seeing snow in dr. brulov's house, drops and breaks a cup full of coffee, no coffee spills on the carpet. instead, we see some thin black disc made from wood or plastic pasted into the cup. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] nurse: [offscreen] miss carmichael, please. dr. petersen is ready for you. see more &raquo; crazy credits just before the opening credits, an overture is played. see more &raquo; connections referenced in 'topaz': an appreciation by film critic/historian leonard maltin&nbsp;(2001) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how does the movie end?

one guess -- david o. selznick! that being said (along with the fact that the story doesn't really add up to much of anything, since all the premises on which it's based seem so shaky, naive and downright goofy), the film has some things going for it. about midway through the picture, when michael chekhov appears as dr. brulov, the film suddenly kicks into what we might call &quot;classic british hitch mode,&quot; with the kind of understated wit and ensemble playing the director had been doing so well since the early 30's. it almost becomes another (and far more palatable) film at this point. the scenes with bergman, peck and chekhov are the highlight of the film, and i have to admit that i'm even kind of fond of the hotel lobby scene, with the appealingly breezy bill goodwin (of &quot;burns and allen&quot; radio fame) as the house detective. peck has never been more handsome, in a strangely fragile way.also worth a look are the brief but truly unusual dali-designed dream sequences. there is something to be said for miklos rozsa's score as well: although it edges a bit far into soupy overscoring, the expressive main theme has quality, and his use of the theremin (which he also employed in his score for the lost weekend at virtually the same time) is striking and represented &quot;something new&quot; in film music.one could easily make excuses for this film based on &quot;it was only 1945&quot; or &quot;what people knew about psychoanalysis was still naive&quot;, etc., but even taken in context of its time it's a pretty silly film without the kind of sustained surety of style leavened with simultaneous suspense, intelligence, taste and humor that he had already proved he could do so well from more than ten years earlier. given a standard he had already given us with examples from the 39 steps or young and innocent through the lady vanishes in the uk, or foreign correspondent and shadow of a doubt here in the us, this film seems not up to his true capacities, and like his other selznick-produced american film, rebecca, seems both overfussy and filled with emphases and spoonfeeding of details which hitch himself would never have given us.you need only compare this film with his very next one, notorious, to be painfully aware how much better hitchcock on his own -- using his own standards of pace, momentum and the adult treatment of script themes -- could be when not under the thumb of selznick. thank god he didn't have to work for him any more after this. 50 of 81 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
