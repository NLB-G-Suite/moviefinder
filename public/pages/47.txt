(director spike lee also appears at a training camp and gives some of the aspiring players some less-than-inspiring advice about what their skills mean to the people at the top of the ladder.)we watch as their poignant, real-life struggles unfold on the screen, and watch as time after time they get stonewalled by the system of bureaucracy and racism that's meant to be especially hard on two young black boys from the ghetto. they have difficulty with making decent grades, financial issues, preparing for the act, sports-related injuries, and must contend with problems at home as well, including trouble with family matters (arthur's relationship with his father is especially touching and sad; william welcomes a new addition to his family while still in high school).for years, success stories, such as &quot;hoop dreams,&quot; have dominated hollywood cinema and have won over legions of audiences, but we've never seen anything like this. gates and agee are both bright-eyed and ambitious that they're embarking on something that's historically significant to their lives and community.this is the best movie about basketball and reality i've seen yet because of the simple fact that it's real; no scripts, no phony hollywood theatrics, just &quot;real&quot; action, drama, and emotions.10/10 20 of 25 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 74 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
