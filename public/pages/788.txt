likable performances by keaton &#x26; davis make &#x27;speechless&#x27; a great one-time watch.&#x27;speechless&#x27; has a interesting plot of of two opposites attracting to each other. the protagonists face-off each other as speech-writers. the political portions, the humorous scenes keep the proceedings alive. the climax has a good twist and penultimate scene does get a smile in your face.if there is something that goes wrong in here, that is clearly it&#x27;s slow-pace. no it&#x27;s not boring at all, but yet you feel some portions could&#x27;ve been easily edited, especially the character of the late christopher reeve.but there&#x27;s no denying that this underrated flick deserves a watch. no it doesn&#x27;t leave you &#x27;speechles&#x27;, but surely manages to entertain. 3 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
