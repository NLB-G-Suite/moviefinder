edit storyline paul is on a business trips to nagoya, as a computer-chip executive from new york, when he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman. later, he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, inadvertently interrupting an assassination by a feared ninja-cult. as he is now the only man to have seen the face of the cult's warrior-leader and lived, he soon realizes that he is facing a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy. teaming up with a friendly samurai couple, on a two-centuries-old blood-feud with the ninja, he struggles to survive. finally, recuperating on an island-fortress, he learns swordsmanship, and perhaps, a little about courage, honor, love, and loyalty. the requisite final confrontation is rife with bloody swordplay and spectacular martial-arts action sequences. written by tad dibbern &lt;dibbern_d@a1.mscf.upenn.edu&gt;

goofs paul racine escapes his ninja pursuers by ducking into a pachinko parlor (a kind of japanese gambling hall). he is aided by a young girl, who takes him to nagoya station, where he catches a 5am bullet train out of the city. it's illegal for anyone under 18 to go into pachinko parlors, so the girl wouldn't be there in the first place. pachinko parlors close at 11pm, meaning that racine would be in for a very, very long wait on arriving at the station. see more &raquo;

&#x22; i am fighting a thousand year old spirit who will not die &#x22; 15 september 2009 | by thinker1691 (usa) &ndash; see all my reviews if you are a fan of action films, like the kind steven segal is usually seen in, this one is for you. the movie cast is superb with veteran actor john lone, playing kinjo. he is usually a good guy but most recently is seen wearing black hats. his acting is incredible as is yoshio harada who plays takeda, a master of kendo or combat art. another actor who is more famous for his &#x27;highlander&#x27; series is christopher lambert who plays paul racine. adding sympathy, compassion and remarkable loyalty is joan chen who plays kirina. the story is of a businessman who happens to be at the wrong place, when he witnesses a japanese woman being murdered. although he is severely wounded, the assassins do not kill him as instructed, but allow him to become a pawn in a thousand year old feud between two rival clans. the drama is top notch, the sword action is exciting and extremely good considering it&#x27;s set in modern japan. the element of spiritual combat is well blended with good old fashion martial arts. recommended for anyone seeking a fine film. **** 7 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
