user reviews &nbsp; terrific acting complements great script 23 december 1998 | by dar star (san francisco) &ndash; see all my reviews this is how it should be done, an exciting, exhilarating movie with great acting and a terrific script which grabs a hold of you and never lets go. mel gibson is fabulous (i'd almost forgotten he could act after all those lame lethal weapon movies). gary sinise, rene russo, and delroy lindo are equally superb. the viewer is always kept on the edge like you're a member of the mullen household waiting to see if tom will ever see his son again. five stars ***** 20 of 32 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
