user reviews &nbsp; tons of suspense, almost too much 5 june 2006 | by ccthemovieman-1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews most of this movie is simply one extremely long suspense scene as a team of americans try to board a passenger jet, disarm a bomb and capture terrorists. after a 10-15 minute opening to set the story up, the rest of it (two hours) is the constant suspense of whether the mission will succeed and what happens along the way. with that much tension for so, the movie would have been more effective had it been cut 15-20 minutes.however, it was never boring. it was far-fetched, however, but many action movies are just that, and this story wasn&#39;t stupid, by any means. i expected such with kurt russell and steven segal in it, but those two were much more subdued than usual.oliver platt, halle barry, john leguizamo and joe morton rounded out a very diverse and solid cast. this is one of those films that really grabs you the first time you see it, but after that, loses its appeal since the suspense is over. definitely recommended for those who like to sit on the edge of their seat and be entertained. 28 of 45 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
