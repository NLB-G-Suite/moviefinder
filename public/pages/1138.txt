trivia jean-luc godard appropriated both the title character and the actor eddie constantine from a popular french series of kiss-kiss-bang-bang films released from 1953 (la m&ocirc;me vert de gris (1953)) to 1963 (&agrave; toi de faire... mignonne (1963)). see more &raquo; goofs just before lemmy caution/ivan johnson meets natasha vonbraun, around 10 minutes into the movie, you can see the crew in the mirror when the camera pans. see more &raquo; quotes lemmy caution: i refuse to become what you call normal. see more &raquo; crazy credits in the original version, the beginning credits flash one line at a time, each one scanning across the screen just below the last. see more &raquo; connections referenced in hard core logo&nbsp;(1996) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; a movie few else would dare. 29 march 2002 | by austen &ndash; see all my reviews godard was one of the most brilliant directors to ever make movies. his rebellious attitude and style simply puts some people off, which is unfortunate since godard's movies are smart, well-crafted and, yes, entertaining.alphaville is most often compared to movies that came after it, which goes to show how unique and groundbreaking it was (even if perhaps this has been obscured in hindsight). what godard achieved is seen best at what hasn't aged. anytime you show computers and technology in a sci-fi movie it invariably will look dated years later. yet godard's stylized approach looks far beyond the superficiality of alphaville. for example, the first scene with lemmy caution in alpha 60 shows him monitored with microphones manipulated about his head. the jerky motion of the mics (equipment that isn't futuristic is the slightest) portray the mechanical control of alpha 60 with cunning insight. the microphones are neither left static nor moved with fluid grace (just as another scene with discontinuous shots of a fight). the ominous, intermittent movements suggest the limitations of this computerized state.i like this movie in its correlation to william s. burroughs' fictional world interzone. alphaville's dr. nosferatu (which translates into the undead, as in vampires) bears some resemblance to burroughs' dr. benway. alpha 60, the monsterous human/machine computer running alphaville, functions much as burroughs' nova mob. concerns over science dehumanizing society are pervasive. the scene where alphaville executes the poets using water ballet echoes the fictional dichotomy the state has drawn. &quot;alphaville&quot; is hypnotic. the continuous use of flashing lights impresses this. the ending is what cracks me up. ending with natasha vonbraun (anna karina) straining to utter &quot;i...love...you.&quot; is this all lemmy caution has faught for, some sentimental tripe? maybe godard subtly revised hitchcock's ending to his second &quot;the man who knew too little&quot;--jimmy stewart delivers the beyond-obvious line, &quot;sorry i'm late, i just had to go pick up henry.&quot; &quot;alphaville&quot; throws together a multitude of increasingly aggresive styles. after &quot;le mepris&quot; in 1963, this movie (if one ever could) shows a transition to godard's scathing &quot;weekend&quot; in 1967. godard made so many wonderful movies each its own treasure. not that everybody should make movies like godard, i do wish everyone could make movies as good as his are. 23 of 30 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
