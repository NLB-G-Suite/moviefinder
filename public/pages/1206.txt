what a fun movie! 31 march 2010 | by vegasniceguy (las vegas) &ndash; see all my reviews if you ever had dreams of being a big-league star, in any sport, then you have to watch this flick. it&#x27;s classic albert brooks. but, it is like watching a rocky comedy. tears come to my eyes evewn after the 10th viewing. fraser is great. you don&#x27;t need to be a sports fan to like the movie, it is good regardless. as a baseball fan, it was nice seeing yankee stadium. i went there in the last year of the original stadium. it was an historical stadium. though, i hated paying $9 for a beer, but it was nice being able to take the subway to get there. other baseball flicks that are good are &#x22;it happens every spring&#x22; and naturally, &#x22;bang the drum slowly&#x22;. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 38 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo;
