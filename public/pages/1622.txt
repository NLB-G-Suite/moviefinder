frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; ok for fans of young. 7 may 2004 | by smatysia (feldene@comcast.net) (houston) &ndash; see all my reviews i guess this is one where you have to pay more attention than i did. i knew something wasn't quite right, but missed the significance of the out-of-place scene with the inconsequential character. so, someone more alert than me would have figured this one out a lot sooner, but would probably have enjoyed the film less. it was ok. it had some interesting stuff going on, but not really enough. good work from sean young, who doesn't seem (to me) to get the credit she deserves, or the good roles that go with it. even a decent performance from edward james olmos, who i've never really cared much for. the rest of the cast was utterly forgettable. they badly needed a better actor to play lt. randazzo. decent photography and evocation of the coachella valley. overall, it's worth checking out on cable if you like sean young. otherwise, skip it. grade: c- 5 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
