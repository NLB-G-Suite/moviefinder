is a wishy-washy mixture of drama that has no weight to it and comedic touches that aren&#x27;t funny. i&#x27;m not really sure what the tone is supposed to be, but what comes across is a middle of the road and somewhat boring film with a doodle-doo score that underlines the film&#x27;s inconsequential nature.aidan quinn acts as though he&#x27;s just been woken from a deep sleep as a man who decides after suffering various calamities (drowned wife, wrecked house, dog with a bad leg) that he&#x27;s had it with god, and sets out to break all ten of the commandments. moving in with his wife&#x27;s sister (courteney cox, right up against the limits of her range) and her errant husband (anthony lapaglia, who&#x27;s okay i guess), quinn enacts his plan in tedious fashion until the bizarre ending comes out of bloody nowhere.maybe writer/director daniel taplitz thought that the religious angle would give the film some depth. it doesn&#x27;t. it&#x27;s a painless experience, watchable in an unengaging kind of way; but there&#x27;s nothing to get hold of, in part because quinn is a flavourless actor and in part because there&#x27;s just not enough meat on the film&#x27;s bones. 0 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
