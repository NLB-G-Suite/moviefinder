in which brad pitt&#39;s mickey brings that entire celtic sub-culture to near preternatural perfection. it&#39;s also a much better movie. i feel that traveler wastes so much of its potential impact with lame ripoff schemes and a confusing sense of who and what the travelers actually are. also, setting it in america is like setting a movie about eskimo life (not that i&#39;m comparing travelers to alaskan natives by any means) in new orleans.north carolina?paxton and marky mark are talented performers but this film, while certainly watchable, doesn&#39;t really seem to get to the point. 4 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
