trivia julia ormond initially turned the part of guinevere down, not finding her independent enough for her liking. see more &raquo; goofs right before guinevere jumps from her carriage, you can see the guy who is actually driving the carriage behind the seat. you can see his face through the hole or slit behind the seat and you can see the reins disappear into a slit just below the seat. see more &raquo; quotes guinevere: if there is any honor in you, promise me never to do that again. lancelot: i don't know about honor. but i promise you, i won't kiss you again till you ask me to. see more &raquo; connections referenced in mythquest: sir caradoc at the round table&nbsp;(2001) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; brother to brother 22 january 2011 | by bkoganbing (buffalo, new york) &ndash; see all my reviews the arthurian legend gets another reinterpretation in first knight with an impressive sean connery as king arthur. the last time connery was at camelot was his appearance as the green knight in sword of the valiant back in 1984. julia ormond is a fetching and beautiful guinevere any knight worth his salt would saddle up and rescue her.richard gere is lancelot and try as he might he comes off as way too american. this role calls for someone with the dash of an errol flynn and i&#x27;m surprised no one ever cast flynn in a camelot tale. gere is not errol flynn, why was no one from across the pond cast? my first guess would be that gere was a box office name, but certainly sean connery in the cast would take care of that.some elements of knights of the round table got into the plot here. lancelot who is kind of a medieval sword fighter for hire rescues the evil prince malagant played by ben cross. he&#x27;s the mordred of this story, not a believer in the ideals of camelot by any means. his philosophy is that arthur is mistaken, men don&#x27;t want brotherhood they want leadership and he&#x27;s just the guy to provide it. cross is also thinking in terms of real politik, guinevere&#x27;s domain of lynness lies adjacent to camelot, good base for an invasion.gere joins the round table brotherhood in part because of sincerely believing in the arthurian ideals, but also to be close to julia ormond. if you&#x27;ve seen any number of camelot based films or have read thomas malory you have some idea on how this will end. but in the case of this particular film, not completely.first knight is not first by any means in camelot films. but it&#x27;s enjoyable enough for the fans of the leads. and ben cross comes really close to stanley baker&#x27;s outstanding mordred in knights of the round table. 13 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
