user reviews &nbsp; give me a break 12 june 2011 | by jana_obrien (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i cant believe that some people gave this such high marks! first off, i have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls. the principal overhears the head thug bullying julie into meeting him &#x22;at the docks...most girls have to beg me for an invitation, and you&#x27;re turning me down?!?!&#x22; yet, even though he overhears this and sees the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork, the principal still sends her to the office?!? yea, right. you cant tell me she is the first girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents.it appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. he says &#x22;if a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it&#x22; yea, right! this gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. get real! and apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. no parent would put up with this crap going on in their child&#x27;s school. if my kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet id be on the phone with state superintendent.the coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight. this is okay? my favorite, though, was the coach telling his &#x22;gang&#x22; to blow up that dudes car.this whole thing was a joke. the thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says &#x22;meet me at the docks&#x22; ok, see, id go inside julies house, pick up the phone, call the cops and say&#x22; some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if i was brave enough&#x22; then, let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep, and arrest his butt. this movie was just lame. 5 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
