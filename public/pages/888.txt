user reviews a much better movie than the &quot;user ratings&quot; would indicate. 21 november 1999 | by txmike (houston, tx, usa, earth) &ndash; see all my reviews i've seen this movie twice, and it is overall better than 80% of the trash movies being released these days.those of you familiar with statistics and &quot;normal&quot; distributions, look at the &quot;user ratings&quot; for this movie. a full 12% give it a &quot;1&quot; rating, which is obviously bogus. look at the shape of the distribution, and you'll see that the valid rating for this movie is somewhere between 7 and 8, which are the most &quot;common&quot; ratings, which makes perfect sense. a 7.5 on a 10 point scale is where most people would rate it.it has such an uplifting story of a re-construction after a war, and banning together to fight evil, that i don't see how anyone with a heart could give it less than about 6 or 7. see it if you haven't already! 79 of 103 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
