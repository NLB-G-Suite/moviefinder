6 august 2000 | by kjsahl (haugasund, norway) &ndash; see all my reviews this film is for the elder audience. don't get me wrong. i recomend everybody to see it. finally the cast is not some teenagers but grown woman. the film is set in a small town where everybody knows everybody. the scandal is a fact when two woman is in love with eachother-one married, with two children. the other a respectfull teacher, who also is a basket ball trainer.the film has some good humor and serious dialog and is a film worth waching for everybody.anita 6 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
