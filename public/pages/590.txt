user reviews &nbsp; very good music! 14 april 2005 | by mark kram (slovenia) &ndash; see all my reviews i've just read a comment that this movie has a lot of bad songs. i absolutely disagree - there may be some weak parts of script or so, but music is indeed very, very good. alan menken made a masterpiece, as usual! the orchestration, score, everything, not to mention good voices of characters. but it is true that maybe this story isn't exactly meant for children, although disney tried to make it closer to a child's ear and eye. i also think that the animation was really good - much more expressive than some of newer disney's movies that were made almost entirely by computers. it's a pity that hunchback wasn't more successful - it certainly deserved it. 46 of 54 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
