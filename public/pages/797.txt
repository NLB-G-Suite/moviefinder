frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; excellent woody allen movie 1 july 2005 | by preppy-3 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews couple larry and carol lipton (woody allen and diane keaton) get involved with a complicated murder (they think) when their next door neighbor's wife dies suddenly. her husband seems strangely calm about it and then carol sees the dead wife alive and well on a bus...this was a return to comedies after allen had made a string of dramatic movies. most people believed he couldn't do comedies anymore. it turns out he hadn't lost his touch and turned out one of his best movies. seeing keaton and allen playing a couple was great (they always worked so well off each other) and, for once, allen isn't the neurotic one--keaton is! it was fun seeing him play the strongest partner in a relationship. the dialogue is hilarious--one good line after another and the murder mystery itself is very intricate and interesting. also there are a number of great old songs playing in the background that perfectly complement the movie--especially &quot;the big noise from winnetka&quot; (for when they drive across the bridge at night). and i loved that homage to orson welles &quot;lady from shanghai&quot; at the end.the acting is almost all great. allen and keaton are just wonderful--right on target and acting (and speaking) like an old married couple. alan alda pops up as keaton's best friend. i never really liked him but he's ok here. anjelica huston (looking incredible) also pops up and gives a very strong (and very funny) supporting role. also look for zack braff (from the tv series &quot;srubs&quot;) in his very first role as keaton and allen's son (!!!)my only complaint--the jerky, hand held camera-work. it worked fine in allen's dramas but is just out of place here--the camera should move fluidly in a comedy. that's a small quibble though. this is well worth seeing. 20 of 25 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
