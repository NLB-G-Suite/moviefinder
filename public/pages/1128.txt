trivia when funds ran out, paul thomas anderson used money new line had advanced him for boogie nights (1997) and donations from his cast to raise the necessary 250,000 dollars to finish the film. the film company rysher signed off on anderson's director cut, on the proviso that he change the title to "hard eight". although anderson agreed to this change, it didn't stop rysher from barely releasing the film. see more &raquo; goofs when john and clementine leave the motel for their honeymoon in niagara falls they are driving a chrysler product, possibly a plymouth gran fury. the chrysler &quot;star&quot; hood ornament is clearly visible as they leave. when they are driving across the desert, a view out the windshield shows a blue-and-white buick regal hood ornament. the character sydney is driving a silver/blue buick regal. see more &raquo; quotes sydney: [at the cocktail lounge] tell me something. are you required to flirt, to behave as you do toward that table of men over there? maybe... it's some part of your job? clementine: uh, they don't say to do it. sydney: but if you don't? clementine: well, then i get questioned, like: "why were so rude to them?", and, i mean, i can't talk back. i can't tell them to fuck off and leave me alone. sydney: as a rule?
