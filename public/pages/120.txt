user reviews &nbsp; just a good bit of fun!! 14 january 2010 | by stedmpy (united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews i don&#x27;t usually comment on this, i don&#x27;t like to portray a movie as being good or bad just on my opinion, as everyone has their own tastes and needs when it comes to cinema. but god damn, why do so many people hate this film.firstly, this is not a serious film, it has never happened nor will it ever. this film is just damn good fun to watch...the explosions, the suspense, the cheesy one-liners...its not trying to tell you that aliens are coming to blow the s**t of of us...its entertainment. to all the people here that have said this is the worst movie ever...you guys need need to watch more movies, because if this is the worst movie ever then im santa clause! to put it simply, this is 2 and a half hours of fun filled, edge of the seat (occasionally have a laugh) action...and nothing else. why cant people just enjoy a independence day for what it is (as mentioned above)...not why its improbable etc etc etc we all know that duh! this film is entertaining, full stop!! and thats all its supposed to be. 71 of 107 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
