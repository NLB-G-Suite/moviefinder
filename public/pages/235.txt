tempe is a rock place that bears women deprived of the happiness at conceiving babies.their wombs are barren and hard like the rocks in the desert. florence,dot and ed are the victims of the metaphor.one takes fertility pills,another adopts orphans,the other after being turn down adoption,steals a baby named nathan jr. nothing could be more exciting than a rebirth. the film tells us what a rebirth is like. push hard through the saturated mud above your head at the 99% risk of being stifled to death. one second delay would be too late. that&#39;s gale and evelle&#39;s narrow escape from the jail. it sounds surrealist. but that&#39;s coens&#39;s wit lies. they twist reality and exaggeration into knots to spin our noggins.snatching a packet of diapers in a convenience store can be a life-or-death chase scene, without mentioning the leather-clad,bonehead,bounty hunter biker, who can browbeat nothing except little animals. troubles arrive in sequence. that&#39;s the way the life is. at the end of the film, h.i. and ed returns the nathan jr.to his parents.it doesn&#39;t belong to them and will never be theirs.why not keep the dream of having kids go on? if h.i.&#39;s dream of the hellion biker is not a phantasm, his dream of being blessed with descendants might come true some day. in despite of the superficially hilarious scenarios, it is a sad story to the marrow. h.i. and ed&#39;s sorrow is not skin-deep and can be felt by any of us who puts heart into this film. 7 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
