see all my reviews the french movie le colonel chabert was shown in the u.s. as colonel chabert (1994). yves angelo directed it. it&#x27;s the story of a brave, highly decorated cavalry officer in napolean&#x27;s army, who is left for dead on the battlefield. he leads a horrible existence for ten years, until he finally manages to return to france. in his absence, his wife has remarried, and now has two children. she also has all of his fortune. who is going to believe chabert&#x27;s story&#x27;s? chabert finds someone who believes him. it&#x27;s the almost superhuman attorney derville. the problem is that derville is also the attorney for chabert&#x27;s former wife.gerard depardieu plays colonel jabert. he is a consummate actor. we know it and director angelo knows it. fanny ardant is the former wife. when she&#x27;s on screen, you can&#x27;t take your eyes off her. she isn&#x27;t beautiful in the classic hollywood way; she&#x27;s beautiful in the french way. she has strong features that tell us that she&#x27;s competent and capable. when chabert asks derville to describe her, he uses just one word--superb.believe it or not, i think the best acting is displayed by fabrice luchini as derville. his part is complex, because derville is an unlikable character. he&#x27;s snobbish, arrogant, and absolutely certain about his professional talents. luchini becomes derville. it&#x27;s worth seeing the movie just to watch him act.we saw this movie on the small screen. (actually on--gasp--vhs.). it worked very well. colonel chabert has a so-so imdb rating of 7.0. it&#x27;s better than that. find it and watch it. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 9 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: boucard hure godeschal desroches simonin boutin chamblin costaz delbecq notary servant ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
