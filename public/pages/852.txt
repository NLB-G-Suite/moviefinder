- put the cookie down...now! - nobody likes you booster (maybe sinbad&#39;s line) - i&#39;m not a pervert... and the many times he says &quot;jamie&quot;, i hated that darn brat...what a spoiled kid anakin was.but this movie is funny how it shows that parents are crazy to get one toy for their spoiled little brat. sinbad is hilarious, and i miss him in movies, and it has the good &#39;ol phil hartman.arnold faces an army of santas, which is funny as well as his corny lines i watch this to hear. although this isn&#39;t the best christmas movie, it&#39;s still enjoyable. 28 of 37 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
