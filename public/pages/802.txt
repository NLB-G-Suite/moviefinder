trivia the line "the weed of crime bears bitter fruit" is taken directly from the conclusion of episodes of the radio show. at the end of every episode, after the announcer has given the credits, the shadow would say "the weed of crime bears bitter fruit. crime does not pay! the shadow knows," and then laughs see more &raquo; goofs when margo lane arrives to rescue the shadow from the water tank, a distant shot shows no water leaking out of the bullet holes farley claymore made. but when she's right by the door, water can clearly be seen leaking out. see more &raquo; quotes the shadow: the weed of crime bears bitter fruit. see more &raquo; connections referenced in special when lit&nbsp;(2009) see more &raquo; soundtracks lullaby of broadway (uncredited) music by harry warren lyrics by al dubin whistled and sung by ethan phillips later sung by john lone while on top of the empire state building see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: list: "the shadow" radio episodes see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews excellent adaptation, highly enjoyable 2 december 2000 | by lethalweasel (toronto, ontario, canada) &ndash; see all my reviews i don't really understand the bad rep this movie has gotten. sure, its not &quot;high art&quot; (then again, shakespeare, dickens and herodetus weren't meant to be, or perceived as, high art when they were written). what the shadow was, and remains, in my eyes, is one of the best super-hero adaptations ever (the best until x-men came out, in my opinion).i'm not terribly familiar with the old radio drama shadow, so i can't speak as to the details, but the feeling, the essence of the movie fits with what i've experienced. much more importantly, it stand out well on its own.special effects play a major part, but are not of the over-played. action is well done, and acting is acceptable, though rarely outstanding (the shadow's cabbie shrebnitz is an engrossing exception).what really makes this movie stand out is the layering. plots, characters, backgrounds, all are complex. the movie's basic plot is well-paced, occasionally a bit slow, but it makes up for it with the incredible wealth of details it packs in. watching the movie, one gets the sense of an incredible amount of backstory for each character (little things, like the family life of some of the shadow's agents, barely glimpsed, or even just the complex web of those agents across the city), or that around the corner there lies a world to explore.this movie can be difficult to classify, which may lead to its unpopularity. clearly its not a drama, not is it a comedy, nor even entirely an action. scifi or fantasy are both possible descriptions, but they fail. the shadow is comicbook style, in the truest sense of the genre. complex characters, pull-pounding action, some jokes, some drama...it all mixes together. if you can get a bead on the style, its a very enjoyable movie, far ahead of most other super-hero films (superman, batman, the phantom, etc.)i recommend watching it, but only with an open mind. 41 of 44 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
