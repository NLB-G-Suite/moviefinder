goofs when nick and the coroner look at the body through the fluoroscope, the bullet, and a piece of shrapnel, appear as bright white. the fluoroscope uses x-rays except it is viewed on a screen instead of film. dense objects, such as bones, appear dark, as it appears in the movie. the bullet and shrapnel should then be even darker as it blocks even more of the x-rays. however, this would not have shown up well in the movies, so they were made bright white so the viewers could see them easily. see more &raquo;

loy comes off very natural, as if they were married.nick is a lovable lush with a sharp mind and nora is rich beyond imagination, with a freshness and innocence not found in today's movie characters. the film has plenty of site gags with some occasional drama interspersed.all of the characters are made believable by the actors and the direction is superb. the plot revolves around the disappearance of prof. wynant and everyone seems to be involved in helping him stay missing. nick reluctantly takes the case and the fun really gets going. plenty of misdirection keeps you guessing &quot;whodunnit&quot;. the now classic gathering of all suspects lets you know. a really odd family, some &quot;shady&quot; characters, and william powell/myrna loy's acting make this one great! this is the first in the thin man series, and, in my opinion, the best.rated 10 in my book. a must see for fans of comedy and classics.where are these kinds of movies nowdays? 24 of 31 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
