frightening authenticity about this engrossing drama. 12 december 2000 | by raymond-15 (australia) &ndash; see all my reviews many films are described as &quot;true life dramas&quot;. but this is the one if ever there was one. the central character jean (cyril collard) a hedonistic young film producer who engages in sex with both men and women mirrors the real life story of cyril collard who was suffering from the aids virus during the making of this film and succumbed to it when the film was finished. this is a great shame because obviously cyril collard has lots of talent both as actor and producer, and had he lived we could have enjoyed a whole lot of top quality films. this film starts on a quiet note but gathers strength after jean reveals he is suffering from aids. his girl friend laura is shocked at the revelation as they had been engaged in unprotected sex. wild scenes of erratic and uncontrolled behaviour indicate the frustrations of the couple. his outburst &quot;i don't want to die!&quot; is a high point and her constant appeal to him to give up his male contacts bears little fruit. &quot;help me to leave you!&quot; is her pathetic cry. cyril collard has a great charm and infectious smile which he uses to advantage in his characterisation of jean. it is a powerful drama with a constant feeling of desperation as we the viewers anticipate the fatal outcome. not a film to cheer you up after a hard day, but it has a frightening authenticity about it which compels you to watch it to the end. the film clearly makes the point that we have a responsibility re the health of others beyond our own self satisfaction. 3 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
