trivia (cab calloway) was offered as another lead singer in the blues brothers after the film was released and the band got back together (in real life) by dan akroyd, but joe declined the offer, because he'd rather stick to being just an acting career and not focus on a singing career as well as an acting career. see more &raquo; goofs as the bluesmobile is driving up out of the river (with the fanatics' boat on top), one can just barely make out an optical effect just under and ahead of the car, roughly aligned with the water pouring off. this was probably the result of a camera trick used to hide a tow cable. see more &raquo; quotes buster blues: smells like dog shit in here. elwood blues: don't say shit kid. buster blues: [buster puts a cigarette in his mouth and prepares to light it, but elwood throws the items out of the car window] elwood blues: you don't need that shit kid. see more &raquo; crazy credits the cast sings several rhythm & blues songs as the credits roll. see more &raquo; connections referenced in the simpsons: there will be buds&nbsp;(2016) see more &raquo; soundtracks theme from peter gunn written by henry mancini performed by the blues brothers band see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; blues brothers 2000? slow and sloppy! 15 september 2000 | by jfett (austin, texas) &ndash; see all my reviews i found ackroyd to be completely horrible. he looked more like joe friday than elwood blues. his chicago accent was forced, the dialog moved through at a horribly slow pace. there was absolutely zero comic timing in this movie. every scene in the movie, including the musical numbers, took too long-from elwood talking to the penguin, to the car chases-long shots of police cars-to the car-under-the-water routing-to the 50 car pile up that seemed to take 10 minutes.the musical numbers-the lifeblood of the original-were completely devoid of soul. aretha franklin's lip-syncing in particular was horrible. matt guitar murphy looked more like a broken down old man than the body-builder he did in the original. who could believe that the `dunn and cropper' radio talk show could possibly exist when they both seemed to be reading off of cue cards the entire movie?the things that we funny and subtle in the first film-elwood's parking ability, jake's transformation at the hands of reverend cleophus, the miracle performance of the bluesmobile, the new jobs of the former band members, were hackneyed and overdone in this film.the lack of energy from the band, though, is the coffin nail for this film.they perform with such little life that cgi animation of a skeleton riding a skeletal horse over the stage has to be imposed during their rendition of `ghost rider.' this comes from the same blues brothers band that made the theme to rawhide sound like a hit twenty years ago.finally, the movie seems too bright and too clean. the original took place at night for the most part, and seemed dungier. this film is shiny and clean and that just doesn't feel right. the new bluesmobile didn't even look right until elwood littered up the dashboard with trash, and-get this-the cigarette lighter worked!other fatal flaws: dumbing-down elwood blues, inserting a kid into the cast, having elwood eat something other than dry, white toast, the shaving-cream-ball schtick, no scmods, no lines like `man, i haven't been pulled over in six months.' all the jokes hit you in the face-like they all have to be explained. complete bomb. 20 of 29 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
