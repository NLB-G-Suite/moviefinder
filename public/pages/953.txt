goofs when miss bentley is listening to the bbc broadcast it reports a meeting between &quot;m.p. [member of parliament] winston churchill&quot; and german foreign minister ribbentrop over german demands that, if not granted, would lead to war. the movie takes place in april 1939, and churchill was not prime minister until may 10, 1940, and not yet a member of prime minister neville chamberlain's cabinet until september 3, 1939. while churchill was still an influential member of the tory party, it would have been unusual for the german foreign minister to confer with him and not lord halifax, who was britain's foreign secretary at the time. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] miss bentley: the story begins on lake como, many years ago during the last fantastic summer before the war. miss bentley: returning to the lake has always seemed like coming home. everyone is so friendly. everyone is welcome. the villa barbianello basks all day long in the lakeside sun, which is hotter than usual for late april. see more &raquo; connections featured in siskel &amp; ebert &amp; the movies: showgirls/canadian bacon/se7en/the run of the country/a month by the lake&nbsp;(1995) see more &raquo; soundtracks aida music by giuseppe verdi performed by accademia musicale italiana see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews uneven, unpleasant 13 december 2004 | by jhirsch-2 (dane, wi) &ndash; see all my reviews i don't usually comment but for once i don't agree with anybody else. quite simply, i think this movie was confused and exaggerated and a waste of acting talent. the premise is a mix of standard conventions, the &quot;white expatriates in a romantic foreign land&quot; meets &quot;laughter in the shadow of war&quot; framework. i wouldn't mind the clich&eacute;s so much, if not for:-edward fox's bizarre performance as the major, where he seems to waiver between creepy predator and grinning imbecile.-typically elegant vanessa redgrave in a goofy impulsive performance where her seemingly complex inconsistencies really just make her look foolish.-uma thurman makes it hard to remember why she doesn't totally suck as an actress. i rarely knew what emotion she was trying to convey but perhaps people could be confused into thinking she was layered and mysterious.-the grinning italians in the background might as well be mario and luigi for all the depth of character we get to see. they bob around happily, cheering and waving and doing pratfalls.-the central element, the love story between redgrave and fox, is totally stiff and unbelievable and made me feel weird just watching it.all told, i watch about 5 videos a week and this is one of the very few movies i have shut off before it's done. stay away. 31 of 53 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 23 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: major wilshaw signora fascioli mr. bonizzoni vittorio balsari signora bonizzoni 1st american lady enrico guido maria 2nd american lady bonizzoni angel bonissoni angel ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
