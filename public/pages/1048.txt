(1983), you will notice i said it was a film i avoided for a while, then finally got around to seeing. in fact, i only heard about the sequel, &quot;the evening star&quot; shortly after i saw &quot;terms.&quot; in fact, &quot;star&quot; came on tv shortly after i learned about it and i decided to give it a watch, even though i was probably going to be bored and disappointed. to my surprise, it was quite the opposite. it may start off on a boring start, but soon you will find yourself very involved with the characters and the multi-story plot, just like &quot;terms.&quot; shirley maclaine handled herself pretty well in this, maybe even more so than &quot;terms,&quot; but miranda richardson and juliette lewis seem out of place and they overact sometimes. jack nicholson's cameo was quite appropriate within the plot and he does a great job. like the first film, the ending is memorable and falls in the &quot;tear-jerking&quot; category. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 40 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo;
