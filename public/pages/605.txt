see all my reviews this is not another of frank capra's sophisticated, stylish comedies of the era. that might explain the reason that &quot;lost horizon&quot; takes a back seat today to &quot;it happened one night&quot; and &quot;mr deeds goes to town&quot;, the immensely critically acclaimed comedies of the time. with the theme of the small man triumphing over the big, good over evil, perhaps here capra was trying to explain idealism over humanity. he believed in the book. in his own words, &quot;it held a mirror up to the thoughts of every human being on earth&quot;. ronald colman is perfect in his role of robert, an english diplomat and a leader of the people. edward everett horton was again great in a seemingly bubbling, comic role and sam jaffe, later the professor in &quot;the day the earth stood still&quot; gives a memorable performance as the high lama, establisher of shangri-la, the perfect world high above in the himalayas. some of the cinematography was absolutely amazing. it was a shame that the film was cut to the extent that footage was lost and stills had to be used in the missing sound track places. the imagery that capra stirs up for the viewer has certainly fulfilled his vision. the film is a bit long in some parts, but it certainly does not fail to entertain, it merely takes its time to tell a great story.is there another film from the period that sums up the great human ideal, a perfect world, a better one than the one we already exist in? &quot;lost horizon&quot; with its ideals is the film for the thinking person. it thrives on its themes for humanity, of kindness and moderation, stripping away the pretense of our lives. the message is as clear as anything, but maybe we all don't want to realise it, or perhaps we can't.i hope that this movie is never remade for a third time. it is a story that could only be preserved in its own time, for this version has the message that still rings clear today, unspoilt, endearing, so simple. hollywood will never again be able to recapture what has been already crafted. capra's neglected movie could scarcely have been more effectively filmed. rating: 10/10 25 of 32 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
