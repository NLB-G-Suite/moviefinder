some old 45&#x27;s. not the guns, the records. oldies but goodies. and to play these hits, she has her old princess record player. let the good times roll! then, the doorbell rings. it&#x27;s randy&#x27;s first guest, and a girl he&#x27;s got the hots for, michelle russell...er sanford, and her overprotective father burt. to tim&#x27;s good fortune, burt is a tool time fan and he loves the episode where tim set his sleeve on fire. momentarily forgetting he hadn&#x27;t any pants on, tim steps out of the basement doorway to greet him.the party was a pretty awkward affair, as nobody set foot on the dance floor. randy and michelle exchange some awkward words, and then he finally gets up the guts to ask her to dance. but no sooner had she stepped on the dance floor that she took a nasty fall. tim, randy and brad help her upstairs, as apparently she sprained her ankle. they had no ice because it had all gone into the punch, so tim soaks her foot in the punchbowl. then it&#x27;s off to the emergency room, where as you may recall, tim is a celebrity. because of that, he manages to get michelle into examination ahead of the line. meanwhile at home, burt shows up, he has a glass of &#x22;foot punch&#x22; and then he freaks out when he hears about michelle&#x27;s little accident. however, he manages to calm down after he and tim find some common ground. burt&#x27;s into muscle cars, he collects them. looks like tim has made a new friend. he takes him out to see the hot rod, and in spite of everything, the party wasn&#x27;t such a total loss. at least randy found out that michelle kinda likes him. we close by tim going down to check out that dance floor. fortunately he brought along his break dancing double.this one was really funny and it was quite a charming episode. the gag of tim greeting burt in his underwear was hilarious, and the part where burt drinks punch that had michelle&#x27;s foot in it earlier reminds me of a similar gag in &#x22;reel men&#x22; where tim eats what he thinks is fondue, but is actually leg wax. so anyway, burt and michelle appear once more in next season&#x27;s &#x22;advise and repent.&#x22; burt is played by character actor mark l. taylor, so it was a shame mark (the character) was barely in this episode. commonly known by fans as &#x22;the one where tim over-waxes a dance floor and randy&#x27;s friend falls&#x22;, i recommend checking out &#x22;it&#x27;s my party.&#x22; 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
