in order to fight him, she must beat everyone else in the competition. there will be blood, for sure.in order to make up for his superficial plot, sam raimi has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. one of his most recognizable through his career is going over the top in an amusing way, which he does here too, mostly at the climax. he doesn&#x27;t make great movies, but he makes clever and entertaining ones, which this is. 15 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
