this is a quietly thoughtful film about friendship and its boundaries. keener is wonderful as the friend who relies on others to help her through life&#39;s ups and downs. even the most cherished friendships need room to breathe and amelia has to learn this the hard way. heche is likewise very fine as the beautiful lady who appears to have it all but may, in fact, have some flaws, too. todd field is great as laura&#39;s fianc&eacute; and schrieber gives a nice turn as a commitment phobic, sexually obsessive addict. all of the production necessities, from costumes to sets to direction, are quite nice. then, too, the script is quirky, funny and original as well. no, this is not a thrill-a-minute adventure, so those who eschew slower paced, dialogue-driven films will want to skip over this one. yet, if you adore romantic dramas brimming with life, humor, and important statements, here is the film you&#39;ve been looking for. walk to the nearest video outlet and peruse the shelves until you grasp this little gem in your hands. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
