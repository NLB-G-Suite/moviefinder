the only and i mean only reason that i even wasted my time watching this movie was because it supposedly &quot;starred&quot; my all time favorite actress, gillian anderson. but gillian, honey. what were you thinking?! this movie lacked any kind of plot of character development. i am wondering who sold their soul to the devil...or paid someone off to even get this film made. they so slyly put gillian's picture on the cover of the movie to lure people in. and then she's in the movie for about 5 minutes. this movie was so boring that it had me wanted to fast forward to the scenes with gillian in them. i can't believe gillian ever even got another role after appearing in this sad, sad excuse for a movie. i am now dumber as a result of watching this film. 10 of 13 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
