trivia sam rockwell does not have a speaking part, but for sr fans this movie will hold some significance. it clearly shows his bandaged left hand after his car accident and reconstructive surgery. he appears in several scenes, and in one, sits gingerly in the back of the truck, protecting his fingers by holding them straight up. see more &raquo; connections featured in siskel &amp; ebert &amp; the movies: the first wives club/big night/surviving picasso/last man standing/paradise lost: the child murders at robin hood hills&nbsp;(1996) see more &raquo; soundtracks looking towards tommorow written by steven randazzo performed by .steven randazzo&#39; see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews innovative and often somber tale of 3 lonely characters 4 november 1999 | by eroka (london) &ndash; see all my reviews i didn't really mean to watch it. i really stumbled over it, saw keitel's name and thought &quot;this must be interesting!&quot;. and keitel, as usual, doesn't fail you. surprisingly, perez does very well on her own, and the cute ex-kid from fame michael delorenzo is really good, in a role that demands that he doesn't know how to dance... ironic, considering he was one of the lead dancers in that 80's series. anyway, these 3 characters go through the he-loves-her-who-loves-another routine, through very unusual twist or events (for one - a hollywood rich producer has a car accident right after perez has left keitel's house - well, he threw her out - and after making perez think that he is the dream she always waited for - that rich guy dies on her - is that a normal plot-driving scene or what?)and quite a few &quot;moments&quot;, as the biscuit from aly mcbeal's would say. this is one to watch, just so you really get into the very thought provoking scenes. i recommend this for every movie lover. it's not an action flick, it's not a normal washy-washy picture either. it's a harsh look at people's despair and how in the end, when all the chips are down, we are left to deal with things on our own... tarantino and rockwell went on to do four rooms, yet another psycho fun-and-deep black comedy. take that out as long as you're in the video store. 6 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
