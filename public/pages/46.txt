trivia dolores fuller has disputed her depiction in the movie, recalling how she helped raise money for glen or glenda (1953), and helped pick out ed's wardrobe for the movie, which included some of her own clothes. fuller also states that her leaving wood was not for the reasons given in the film, but because of his alcoholism, which was not depicted. see more &raquo; goofs dolores' hair is shorter and in a different style when she runs out of the wrap party. see more &raquo; quotes [making up the bald dr. tom to look like bela lugosi] makeup man harry: ed, what am i gonna do here. edward d. wood, jr.: what do you mean?
