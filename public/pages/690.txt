see all my reviews the browning version(1994) director mike figgis(leaving las vegas)does a wonderful job in this remake of the 1951 classic about an unpopular teacher( albert finney) who realizes his life has been a failure after being forced into early retirement because of a heart condition and his relationship with his 20 year younger unfaithful wife(played by the beautiful greta scacchi).its always a pleasure to see finney, certainly one of the finest actors alive,and maybe even the best, give a gut wrenching performance as the out of touch teacher forced to face an uncertain future. the excellent supporting cast includes julian sands and matthew modine. a very intelligent, well made movie recommended for all serious film buffs 19 of 23 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
