considering the cast, seemed too amateur 9 october 2011 | by gavin6942 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews a mousy office worker (carol kane) accidentally kills one of her coworkers, then proceeds to bump off a few others.besides carol kane, the &#x22;star&#x22; of this film is molly ringwald, who shows us that she is no longer america&#x27;s sweetheart. her adult acting ventures have not panned out so well for her. and i am not saying she is a bad actress, but after her john hughes years, she will have to do more than appear in one or two disposable films to re-create herself.and does carol kane age? i had always believed she was older in &#x22;princess bride&#x22;, but now know she was only 35 (and therefore 45 here). i am not sure if i am impressed by her lack of aging or dismayed that she has always looked 60 years old...but, as far as the film goes, i just did not think it was that great. there was some humor, but nothing that really hit me (i have seen other comments from people who think it is funny, but i disagree). the dead body effects are decent, but there is just something about the film quality that gives off an &#x22;amateur&#x22; effect and makes the whole thing seem poor. and i do not mind independent films if they are done right, so it is not just the cheap look but something about how it comes across here. not my cup of tea. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
