user reviews &nbsp; unbelievable 23 january 2005 | by antialias11 (bonn, germany) &ndash; see all my reviews that anime could be this good. i'd thought i'd seen good anime when a friend brought me 'akira', but this one is just awesome.it has everything that one could want. an interesting plot, deep thoughts, nice dialog, hot chicks, cool action, neat tech, and animation that puts everything to shame which has ever been produced in the western world.now when i watch anime i usually expect (and dread) the scene which will explain something about the fundamental nature of life, the universe, or whatever. this is (the only part) where 'akira' failed. this is where 'final fantasy' went down the drain. but 'ghost in the shell' shines here brightly. while watching it for the first time i had always this nagging feeling that some such scene would turn up and ruin the truly stunning visuals. not so. after the '2501' monologue the story really comes together and you start to be eager for story development instead of just looking for the many details and extravagant action sequences.a word on the story: no, you will probably not 'get' the story the first time around. especially in the english version you will have to make the connection between mofa, mf, mfa and ministry of foreign affairs, that is easy to get confused over. the whole storyline might not be quite as complicated as understanding some 'aeon fluxx' episodes, but you have to rewatch the story to get a feel for the interconnection of the different players - especially if you are not familiar with the ghost in the shell literature. the story,thank god, is not dumbed down for the average viewer. this is what makes rewatching it so enjoyable. it has also some nice reflections on what it means to be human - things you may ask of yourself after the movie finishes ('who knows what's inside our heads. have you ever seen your own brain?').the animation is superb, and used to unusual effect. the details are exquisite - especially cloth effects and character motions. there are a few scenes that only have music or an accentuating sound effect in the background while the animators show off their full artistic talent. but it's not just show-off time, the visuals are tied in with the subject and leave the viewer time to reflect on the philosophical/sociological messages (like showing the cybernetic heroine look at tailors' dummies)in short: this is a must see for anybody who likes anime. definitely a movie for grown-ups, though, because the graphic violence may disturb kids and the philosophy will go right over their heads.10/10 43 of 45 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
