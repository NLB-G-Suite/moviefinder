see all my reviews anastatsia is without doubt one of the best animated movies ever made, for several reasons. it's an amazing story, filled with adventure, romance, smart dialog and wonderful music. the story is set in russia and other parts of europe, both in the wonderful palaces of the czar family and the french countryside. it tells the story of the lost princess anastasia, and uses the rumors that she as the only one of the romanov family survived the massacre during the russian revolution. anya, a girl with no memory of her past, meets with two men of questionable professions that promise to take her to paris, if she's willing to try to convince the dowager emperess that she might be anastasia... unfortunately, the evil sorcerer rasputin (the man who killed the romanov family) also knows that anya is alive, and swears to kill her, whatever the cost... so anya is taken on a magical adventurous ride through europe, to find her family. one of the best things about the movie is the characters. they seem so real, like real persons, not platonic, &quot;a beautiful damsel in distress&quot;, &quot;a handsome hero&quot; end of story... the music is wonderful, better than in many disney movies, and the story very good.the only things i don't like about the film, is the things that's dangerous about making movies about real historical events. the romanov family weren't the innocents victims they're painted out to be, and the fact that the story is based on that... but i've only started to think about this now when i'm older, so... anyone who likes a good movie, rent or buy anastasia. it's worth it. i should recommend the swedish version, if someone here was to see it. helen sj&ouml;holm is the singer of anya's role, and she is one of the best singers in sweden... 29 of 41 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
