trivia there had been talk of a film version in 1984. james mason agreed to play kurt, but died from a heart attack before filming could begin. richard burton was considered as his replacement, but he died from a cerebral hemorrhage before he could accept the part. the first attempt to film this story, in 1987, ran over budget and was stopped after six weeks of shooting while only ten days of filming remained. according to stephen king, who saw a rough cut of three-quarters of the movie, "it was really good". it starred ricky schroder as todd bowden and nicol williamson as kurt dussander, and was directed by alan bridges. see more &raquo; goofs a 3-point line is visible on the school's basketball court. the setting of the movie is 1984 and the 3-point line wasn't introduced to the high school game until 1987. see more &raquo; quotes kurt dussander: [seeing the ss uniform todd has bought for him] mary, mother of god! see more &raquo; connections referenced in a night at the movies: the suspenseful world of thrillers&nbsp;(2009) see more &raquo; soundtracks tony's analysis written by van alexander see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; a brilliantly concocted mindgame between a nazi, a boy, and you. 27 june 1999 | by eo5 (nyc, ny) &ndash; see all my reviews this film is not for the light of heart or of mind. the story is about a boy who learns that a nazi war criminal is living right in his metaphoric backyard. obsessed with learning more than just what they teach you in school, the boy sets off on a journey to discover &quot;how did it feel?&quot; the writing, based on a novella by stephen king, takes you through the minds of both the boy and the nazi. it's a battle of wits with real people being the pawns. this movie will mess with your mind. do not watch it if you aren't up to the challenge. my hat goes off to brandon boyce and bryan singer, the writer and director, respectively, who seem to have interwoven the story and the audience. never have i witnessed such an excellent display of psychological warfare. 30 of 41 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
