20 november 2005 | by theo robertson (isle of bute , scotland) &ndash; see all my reviews carpool was produced by warner bros , a film studio with a long history of movie making . you'd think the studio heads would know what makes a successful entertaining film so couldn't have come up with something better than this ? what's that old saying &quot; never work with children or animals &quot; ? the studio broke one of the rules by employing children as main protagonists and while we don't have much in the way of animals we see another golden rule broken , the one that states &quot; never work with a duff script &quot; . a man drives his children to school only to get kidnapped by a desperate robber . you probably think you've seen this premise a million times before but it's not really a plot that's been filmed all that many times , probably because it's so weak and obvious which leads me to be confused as to how it survived its pitch . i guess the studio must have been really short of good ideas that month . the already weak plot is brought done even more by the way the actors mug for the camera and the really weak situations: &quot; you put the gun down - no you put the gun down &quot; which means it's not really worth your time seeing 8 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
