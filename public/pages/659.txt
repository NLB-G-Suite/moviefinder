trivia the film was often compared and likened to the exorcist (1973) with some public and critics saying the film was a rip-off of, inspired by, part of a cycle, influenced by, a copy of, similar to, of the same ilk / genre, or a knock-off of. it has been alleged that actress susan swift was directed to look-like and resemble and shown in particular camera angles to signify to audiences actress linda blair from the exorcist (1973). audrey rose (1977) was made and released about four years after the exorcist (1973). see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] janice templeton: ivy! ivy templeton: hi mom! see more &raquo; connections referenced in blue nude&nbsp;(1978) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how much sex, violence, and profanity are in this movie?
