that is when the bitching starts! one false word and you pay the price with these gals. robin tunney sizzles as the naive natural witch, with a power beyond good and evil. neve campbell: does not get any better than that, all in black. rachel true is well cast as the misplaced black girl, whom puts every one else in their place. we all know, however, that the best actress award in this flick goes to fairuza balk, as she fries the role, and the rest of the film with an over-the-top performance. balk milks the film for all it is worth, when bringing down the tone to a very black, violent,and witchy nature. flemming does a magical job transforming these four beauties into guardians of the circle. when first heard of, this would sound like an a-class &quot;carrie&quot; rip-off, but then watch it and realize, it deals with more than powers. it deals with the rules of the wicca generation, and history of the witch. carrie white was an all powerful demon who stands the test of a different time, these babes, are 100% witches, and ready to turn you upside down! great job flemming, you brought us an exciting film, enjoyable over and over again. 34 of 51 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
