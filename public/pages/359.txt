frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; a good movie 29 january 2003 | by furiousneon &ndash; see all my reviews sudden death was a good action film. the plot was simple and easy to understand..it didnt try to become something it isnt and end up confusing you. jean-claude van damme gave a strong performance and so did powers boothe. he was extremely convincing as &quot;the bad guy&quot;. the movie at times is a little far fetched..but most movies are. i also thought it was very cool how jean-claude's character used lots of odd objects to create weapons(fire extinguisher, tube and darts)..anyway if your looking for a good action movie to watch, sudden death should be your choice. 16 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
