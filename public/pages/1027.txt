(one of these is really funny. how do you portray an actor among actors playing non-actors. well, you get a noticeably bad actor. i wonder if heston knows he'll be goofed on for this for many decades as this film outlives his sandled perorations.)--he introduces some almost satirical film reflections: a cheesy ghost, an errol flynn chandelier swing...--he provides visual overlays for some of the images implied in the text: hamlet's lovemaking, considerations in norway, reflections of the players. this ruins a few of the important ambiguities but we do have a wealth to spend after all.--in perhaps the worst loss of ambiguity, he makes fortinbras an invader. this is done only to allow for some cinematic sweep at the end. okay, i'll reluctantly buy it since the alternative is extended mugging in the death scenes.i think branagh and collaborators meet the first challenge nearly perfectly. as to the second challenge, this is our very best film version, in part because of extending the us tradition of playing the characters as real people (versus the uk tradition of characters as speechifiers). so far as the cinematic challenge, there are some great, really great visions here, but there are also some big cinematic misses which keeps this far from perfect. until greenaway attempts it, this is the best film hamlet we have, and that simply makes it one of the best, most rewarding films ever. i'll bet branagh tries again before he dies. 61 of 87 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 225 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: attendant to claudius attendant to claudius attendant to claudius stage manager ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
