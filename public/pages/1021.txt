trivia chance was portrayed by an american bulldog in the first film and in this sequel he is called an american bulldog, but this isn't accurate. in this film, chance is portrayed by an american pit bull terrier. chance's face was more mushed in the first film and in the sequel it appears longer. american bulldogs have mushed in faces, while pit bulls don't. see more &raquo; goofs some scenes show the vancouver, not the san francisco skyline. see more &raquo; quotes chance: jamie? is that you? wait, what am i talking about? of course, it's you! it's really you! i found you! i found my boy! i found my jamie! oh, i'm so happy! oh, i could just lick you for days! give me a hug! see more &raquo; connections edited into doggiewoggiez! poochiewoochiez!&nbsp;(2012) see more &raquo; soundtracks bring it to me written by james mcgee, randy pringle, scottie freebies and krisna booker performed by collective thoughts courtesy of transition music see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; engaging sequel, a notch above usual kiddie fare 6 september 1999 | by scott piehler (atlanta, ga) &ndash; see all my reviews i rented this mostly for my 4-year-old daughter, who enjoys both the 1963 original &quot;incredible journey&quot;, and the 1993 remake. she thought the sequel was very funny, particularly some of sassy the cat's antics. i must admit, the movie took me in as well.the sequel is a little heavier-handed than the 1993 remake. not only do our three main characters have to get home, but they have to defeat a gang of city dogs, outwit two dognappers who are trying to sell strays to the &quot;the lab&quot;, rescue a child from a burning building, and find true love on top of it all!still, not a bad way to spend 89 minutes. michael j. fox is again excellent as chance, sally fields is full of indignation as sassy, and ralph waite does an eerily accurate recreation of the late don ameche's characterization of shadow. sinbad is wasted as reilly, their new city dog friend. the character seemed to be more of an afterthought than anything.most pleasant surprise: al michaels, tommy lasorda and bob uecker as three dogs &quot;broadcasting&quot; a pee-wee baseball game. if you are looking for a movie to enjoy with your children without feeling totally insulted, homeward bound ii is a solid bet. a few tense moments, but nothing that should upset anyone beyond the teletubbies set. 4 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
