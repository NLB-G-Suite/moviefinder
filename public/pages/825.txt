user reviews &nbsp; the best in the series so far. 14 july 2005 | by raoul dyssell (cape town, south africa) &ndash; see all my reviews i must confess, i am rather upset that so many gave this movie such a poor star rating. in terms of violence it is the goriest halloween of them all, and on the basis of sheer thrills, it should already get at least 6/10. having said this, i didn't enjoy jamie llyod getting knacked like that. but then again, that sets the tone for this film - it is a very dark and unsettling one. halloween 6 did do one great thing-confuse the heck out of everyone. it certainly is far better than the rubbish halloween 5. i was little puzzled at how jamie had her baby- what i mean is, who was the father? and did the infamous &quot;man in black&quot; set up her death. oh, and where was she for the last six years. i mean, surely if she disappeared along with michael at the end of the last film, he would have killed her then, wouldn't he.anyway, there are far greater aspects in the film to cover up for this little plot hole, such as the amount of scares and clever deaths. michael's mask is by far the best in the series so far, and the cinematography, in terms of lighting, helps provide that dark atmosphere of this film. the performances are very good- they convey a lot of emotion and fear. the film ends nicely with a respectful dedication to donald pleasance, and leaves room open for another sequel. i am thoroughly upset however, that h2o simply went on by ignoring all the events that took place in episodes 4-6. i mean, michael still has another living relative. his niece, jamie lloyd's baby. i mean really, that seems like a pretty decent aspect to center another sequel around. instead, they go on and mess up the series completely. however, halloween resurrection wasn't a bad film, despite busta rhymes terrible performance.i just hope they finish off things with the 9th installment, and that they tie up loose ends, such as what happens with the baby. afterall, michaels entire inspiration for killing is to murder all the members of his family, and those that stand in his way. if anyone has anything to say about my comment, please write back. id like to know what you think 6 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
