see all my reviews i found 'broken english' one night at the video store when i was bored and couldn't find anything else to rent. i read the caption and that was enough to perk up interest. i have to say i thought the movie was pretty cool, although i agree that there are major gaps in what makes people like ivan and his son darko tick. the racism of ivan, of course, is just ridiculous. not that they used it in the film, but that he should have the gall to treat the maori culture so shabbily (what is that black child doing in the family if he doesn't like black people??). after all, his family came to nz fleeing war, not the other way around. the maori were happily (hopefully so)going about their business long before the croats showed up (probably the same could be said for the english, the scots, the irish and all the other euro-peans arriving on boats to lord and rule for all these years). at least the film gives people, particularly american audiences, a glimpse into a little known culture like new zealand (kiwi fruit and russell crowe, that's about it--and he gets tagged as aussie most of the time). a shame is that marton csokas only gets to give himself to us as a straight-up meat head (a very good portrayal, but a meat head nonetheless) because he's a talented fellow. ah, well, such is life.tee 2 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
