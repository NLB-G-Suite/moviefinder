frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; a cool, enigmatic film, but stylish... 13 september 1998 | by susan thrasher &ndash; see all my reviews an interesting film with an undercurrent of sexual repression similar to that in campion's other films. nicole kidman is excellent, given the material, though her transition from likeable, virtuous innocent to a cold and corrupted woman doesn't ring as true as it should--the three years glossed over with a subtitle isn't adequate to show the change. i blame this on the interpretation, direction, and/or editing rather than kidman's performance, however. malkovich is not as strong, and one wonders what any woman could see in him as a lover. the ending is cold and unsettling. most filmgoers prefer to know that their hero/heroine is &quot;safe&quot; at the end of the story. here, who knows ?production values are good, and the film is quite stylish with interesting use of camera tilt, lighting, and angles. it's quite artsy. i am glad i saw the film, but acknowledge it's not likely to be everyone's cup of tea. 16 of 18 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
