frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews great non-crime elmore leonard 27 september 1998 | by aaron fuller (ellicott city, md) &ndash; see all my reviews occasionally elmore leonard writes about something other than the underworld. here his wonderful dialogue and amusing characters are centered around, not a bank robber or ex-con, but a young man who receives miraculous stigmata. the tone is stirical and the comedy is quite dark; definitely worth a look. after get shorty hollywood seemed to finally get how to translate leonard to the screen, and touch certainly belongs in the company of get shorty, jackie brown, and out of sight. the cast is perfect in this one, with skeet ulrich and bridget fonda the best they've been so far, plus christopher walken in full glory, and tom arnold (yes, that tom arnold) just dead on as a religious zealot. this one didn't get much of a theatrical run so go find it at the video store. 7 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
