would have had to accelerate it to speeds to reach hyperspace and then maintain that velocity until the body reached earth's atmosphere.assuming that near-relativistic speeds are possible in the starship troopers universe, the asteroid should have caused massive damage on earth far beyond the simple destruction of one major city. given the size of the asteroid shown in the film, it's likely that all life on earth would have been extinguished either instantaneously or within weeks or months after massive firestorms and the spread giant clouds of dust and debris. see more &raquo;
