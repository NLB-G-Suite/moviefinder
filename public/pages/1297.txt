quotes david, aged 15: if you were different from anybody else in town, you had to get out. they used to say in school, "you have to think for yourself," but you couldn't do that in town. you have to think what your father thought and that was what everybody thought. see more &raquo;

the bizarre framing sinks the film 23 november 2011 | by theo robertson (isle of bute , scotland) &ndash; see all my reviews this is a film that should appeal greatly to me . it&#x27;s set against the background of a teenage boy growing up in a small insular town . this mirrors my own earlier life . &#x22; no one is allowed an opinion of their own &#x22; proclaims protagonist david and it&#x27;s something i can bitterly relate to . growing up in a small town is a painful experience especially for an existentialist who is an outsider . you&#x27;re conditioned to be a nobody . think of a combination of lysenkoism and the antithesis of ambition . that&#x27;s what life is like in a small town the world over . in short this should be a film that takes people in to themselves creating a strong and instant sense of empathy . alas it;s something of a cinematic disasterthe problem lies entirely at the feet of director terence davies . he directs in a poetic style or at least attempts to but where as a poetic film by terewnce malik or sam mendes works here it spectacular fails . . what sinks the film is the unnatural framing where a character is smack bang in the middle of the screen facing the camera . a lot of critics complain that a director like danny boyle shoots , frames and edits films in a similar manner but at least he brings a sense of variety to his movies . here however davies relies on the exact same framing technique throughout the entire film which sinks it as a cinematic presentation and feels more like a filmed theater play 0 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
