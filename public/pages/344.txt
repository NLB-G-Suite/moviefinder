edit did you know? trivia the film is set in san francisco, but actually filmed in pittsburgh. they used grant street in downtown pittsburgh because it is a brick road like many of the roads in san francisco. also the front of the hospital is really one mellon bank center located on grant street, the same building in the helicopter scene of jean-claude van damme's sudden death (1995). see more &raquo;

see all my reviews although following the formula for films in its class, including a saved dying child, a brave female doctor, a psychopath, and a dedicated detective trying to save his son, even the mandatory car chase sequence, i still found &quot;desperate measure&quot; an exciting and enjoyable thriller. the locations and presumably some sets are effective as is the dialogue and general situation set ups. it has great stunts, some by keaton and garcia themselves. the movie has not been well received by jaded critics who too easily criticize the formula elements, in my opinion. it has the high production values often found in many such films. 13 of 18 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
