trivia during a scene where derek's van swerves off the road and runs over one of the aliens, ken hammon sat on the hood of a van because they weren't able to buy a camera mount for the hood. peter jackson was driving, but neither noticed a tree stump hidden in the tall grass. the van stopped immediately from high speed, launching ken and the camera into the air. amazingly, both hammon and the camera came out fine, but said, "we ain't doin' that one again!" see more &raquo; goofs when frank is in the middle of the field being shot at by the aliens in the tree, the wires controlling the squibs are visible. see more &raquo; quotes frank: this isn't gonna be another false alarm like the manor street invasion over there, is it?
