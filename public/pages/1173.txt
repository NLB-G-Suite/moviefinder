see all my reviews dennis farnina and bette midler are the best chemistry match for this outrageously screwball comedy.attending their daughter&#x27;s wedding, after 14 years of being divorced from each other, and remarrying, the two despise each other and pull absolutely no punches. after a major screaming match at the reception, the two are put out in the street and told to calm down. it is at this point that the old feeling captures them and the picture becomes an absolute madcap comedy. the duo run off and are pursued by the daughter, and a photographer who can&#x27;t stop snapping pictures of midler.while on their escapades, the daughter realizes that she has feelings for the photographer. she has married into a political republican family who pride themselves on good family values. some values. while waiting for his bride to return, the young husband gets drunk and has a one-night fling with farina&#x27;s second wife!the ending is an absolute pip in the tradition of the 1930 screwball comedies. this is a marvelously crafted film- one of the best of this type that i&#x27;ve seen in years. 4 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
