are you people insane??? 22 february 2009 | by horrorfilmx (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this is clearly one of the great animated features of all time. how it squeaks by with a mere 7.4 voter average while all sorts of contemporary crap does far better is a mystery and a tribute to the downward spiral in cinematic taste. dumbo is my favorite of all the classic disney films (a group which ends with jungle book, completed after walt&#39;s death). nothing since then has been able to recapture the magic. walt may have been, according to some people, a fascist and an anti-semite, but he was also a genius.things that make this movie great: the animation (i used to work at a zoo, and while the real elephants did little talking or singing the animators captured their body language incredibly well.)&quot;pink elephants on parade&quot;.effective but not over-the-top heartstring tugging.the musical crow number (&quot;when i see an elephant fly&quot;). i&#39;m disappointed to discover the voice actors (including cliff edwards, &quot;ukelele ike&quot; and the voice of jiminy cricket) were white guys playing black --- i was hoping they were some cool unknown black combo --- but it&#39;s a terrific number anyway.the 64 minute running time. it starts, tells it&#39;s simple story, then knows when the hell to get off the stage. i wish more film makers had that ability. 11 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
