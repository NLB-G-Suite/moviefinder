don't get tired of it. 13 august 2004 | by didldoc (rhinebeck,ny) &ndash; see all my reviews i was completely unaware of this movie when it was in theatrical release.i stumbled across it while watching on cable, and was immediately entranced.although it is edgy and modern, it has a similar allure for me as &quot;a thousand clowns&quot;(jason robards,jr).new york city is a principal character(i admit that the locations in lower manhattan are my old stomping grounds)which will usually add to the appeal of any movie. following redmond as he wanders from his lower east side home to bizarre beer distributor wars to incomprehensible black market deals to the haunting allure of an alcoholic flight attendant 'guardian angel' is funny,compelling, and repeatedly watchable. corrigan's efforts in front of and behind the camera are admirable.not to be missed is james woods' uncle sam. he's a crazy incorrigible hustler who adds a wistful element to a lowlife character. 3 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
