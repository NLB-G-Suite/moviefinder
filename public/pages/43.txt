trivia judy parfitt was recommended for the role of vera by director taylor hackford's wife, helen mirren. parfitt, who had largely confined her career to the stage, was virtually unknown to film audiences at the time. after auditioning with kathy bates, bates reportedly turned to hackford and gasped "who was that?" they agreed to cast parfitt on the spot. see more &raquo; goofs since delores worked and lived in vera's home, one would expect to find her hair, blood and dna (if dna testing was done at that time) in the home. so the hair and blood samples collected by the detective would not help to prove delores murdered vera. furthermore, the postman came into vera's home every day at noon, his dna would be in that house as well. see more &raquo; quotes selena st. george: [referring to her mother's relationship with vera donovan] these two women loved each other! see more &raquo; connections referenced in miracles and mystery: creating 'the green mile'&nbsp;(2006) see more &raquo; soundtracks night in the afternoon written by hendrik muerkens see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: was there really a total solar eclipse in 1975?
