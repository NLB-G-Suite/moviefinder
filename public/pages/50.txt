see all my reviews i absolutely loved the movie, it's the second time i'm seeing it and i'm glad i did, because i love epic dramas...and this one well, not only did it have a great and an original storyline, it had a great cast also. but my favorite had to be brad pitt, his performance was engaging and i couldn't take my eyes off the screen, because i simply was fascinated by the way the story was constructed. i've read a few comments made here...and this film is everything but predictable. it has so many twists and turns that it just keeps you wondering until the end...where you feel like you've watched the film to its fullest and there's no more stories left untold, that's what i look for in a good film. even though the story was tragic, it was a story of love, loyalty and family. i give it a 9/10...if you haven't seen this movie yet...see it! you'll love it, even if you don't fancy brad pitt. 69 of 84 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
