see all my reviews i thought this was a tightly-written, well-directed, superbly-acted film. it moved me to tears. rang true &amp; clear. happy ending &amp; all, it depicted the angst &amp; turmoil of the shallow relationships this culture encourages.... the characters did the work &amp; found their true mates as a result. too slow for american hyper/commercial attention spans, for sure. more like a european film in that regard. brave &amp; moving. glad i saw it. 7 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
