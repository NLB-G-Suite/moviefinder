'vertigo' is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! almost as good as stewart is kim novak ('the man with the golden arm') in a role that she will always be remembered for. 'vertigo' is a virtuoso piece from hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. however the most important thing about it is that it is still wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. in my mind it is one of the three of four greatest american movies. simply astonishing. 93 of 145 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 706 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: scottie's doctor pop leibel car owner mistaken for madeleine ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
