edit storyline udo kier is without a doubt the sickliest of vampires in any director's interpretation of the bram stoker tale. count dracula knows that if he fails to drink a required amount of pure virgin's [pronounced "wirgin's"] blood, it's time to move into a permanent coffin. his assistant (renfield?) suggests that the count and he pick up his coffin and take a road trip to italy, where families are known to be particularly religious, and therefore should be an excellent place to search for a virgin bride. they do, only to encounter a family with not one, but four virgins, ready for marriage. the count discovers one-by-one that the girls are not as pure as they say they are, meanwhile a handsome servant/communist begins to observe strange behaviour from the girls who do spend the night with the count. it's a race for dracula to discover who's the real virgin, before he either dies from malnourishment or from the wooden stake of the communist! written by jonathan dakss &lt;dakss@columbia.edu&gt;
