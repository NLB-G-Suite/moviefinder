see all my reviews a brilliant performance by juliet stevenson is one of the highlights of this mini-series that studies the how to do &quot;don't get mad get even&quot; in british politics. how a scorned wife gets even with her husband should be a cliche, but a great script and good performances from all (incl. a small but pivotal role for minnie driver), moves it far away from cliche. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
