edit storyline lewis is a young sydney amateur theater director at his first experience: he is offered a job with a governmental program for the rehabilitation of mentally ill patients in a sydney institution for mentally ill. his project is overrun by one of the patients roy who wants to put on stage cosi fan tutte (mozart). none of the patients in the cast is able to sing and none of them knows italian which is the language of the libretto. through a lot of difficulties lewis and his cast develop a deep understanding. the play smartly adapted for the unusual cast is finally produced: lots of unforeseen situations solved 'a la crazy way'but indeed brilliantly. great success and sad farewell of the director from his cast. written by lorenzo matteoli &lt;matteoli@iinet.net.au&gt;

see all my reviews i found this film by accident the other night, occupying the late-night slot on terrestrial. i'd never heard of it, but from the first few moments of watching it - it was already 20 minutes in - i was rolling with laughter, and completely keyed-in to the fine display of ensemble acting, occasional surreal moments, lovely characterisations and brilliant humour. the film was touching too without ever being mawkish.a real treat. 5 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
