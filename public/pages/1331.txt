dafoe, lena olin and miranda richardson must all have been in dire need of funds to sign up for such a terrible farce of a film. part costume drama part soft core porn (under the pretense of a foreign film) the image of his glutes bumping up and down will forever haunt and torment me. the 360 of willem and lena olin's embrace is worthy of being compared to orson welles. 8 of 17 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 3 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: prison guard the governor the marquise's maid the marquis aristocrat the marquise julie armande justine official ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet!
