see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; now here&#39;s a strange and fascinating story 30 august 2006 | by ccthemovieman-1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this is a different story and definitely interesting. the movie is listed as a comedy but it&#39;s more of a drama. yes, the comedy is there but it&#39;s dark humor and there is violence and tragedy here. nicole kidman is very good as the beautiful and ruthless blonde who has big television ambitions. i don&#39;t know if i ever saw kidman look this pretty, which is saying a lot. matt dillon co-stars and is excellent, too, as are the two young no- name actors, joaquin phoenix and allison foland. ironically, phoenix, has become a big star, most recently playing the legendary johnny cash in &quot;walk the line.&quot; when this movie came out, few people knew him.illena douglas gives an underrated performance and i always enjoy the odd dan hedaya. anyway, if you want to see something different in the way of a story, this movie falls in that category. 27 of 38 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
