user reviews &nbsp; excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away 27 july 2006 | by grace zeh (filmgirlgz@gmail.com) (chantilly, virginia, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews even though i haven&#39;t read the book, if you ask me, disclosure is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away. meredith (demi moore) kind of gave me the creeps. you&#39;ll understand why once you&#39;ve read the book and seen this movie. however, i loved the way that catherine (roma maffia) worked with tom (michael douglas). in my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. also, the soundtrack is really good, too. before i wrap this up, i must warn you that this movie has some heavy sexual content if you&#39;re going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. now, in conclusion, if you enjoyed michael crichton&#39;s title novel or like barry levinson films, i highly recommend this movie. it&#39;s sure to keep you guessing from start to finish. 17 of 22 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
