van-damme's best 8 november 2005 | by joes_poop (canada) &ndash; see all my reviews wow! i think van-damme out did himself on this one. before you watch this movie you have to prepare yourself for the non-stop action, i mean non-stop. rodman, even has a couple good one-liners, but not as good as van-damme. the movie is probably one of the most entertaining masterpieces that the action genre has seen. van-damme really puts his skills to work in this movie, and mickey rourke was cast perfectly in this movie, and his on-screen chemistry with van-damme is just spectacular. a brilliant story line and damme good action are what really bring this movie together, the action scenes are like watching michelangelo's david take shape and all you can do is stand in awe at it's beauty. van-damme is a man on a mission, and won't stop for anything on this roller coaster ride of excitement, laughter, and adventure. 29 of 51 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
