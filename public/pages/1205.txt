sumptuous period coming-of-age melodrama 18 june 2001 | by (thehumanduvet@hotmail.com) (uk) &ndash; see all my reviews beautifully shot and played, this tale of a young boy coping with the depression better than his father (who has left him alone in seek of work) trips along nicely, detailing the superkid's adventures in thirties america in rich colours and lavish period detail. although it could be accused of overdoing the rose-tinted spectacles, it's a warm and mellow look at a dark and grimy time, and includes enough unpleasantness to keep that fact in the viewer's mind. although the hotel-dwelling salesman living on the edge of subsistence is not a new theme, any more than that of the capable child flourishing in adversity, soderberg brings a timeless quality and a steady, gentle mood to this piece, making it more about the hearts of the people than the tragic times which are displayed. jesse bradford, as the central child, and adrien brody as his older friend, really shine. nice. 13 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
