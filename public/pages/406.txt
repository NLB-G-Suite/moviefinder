see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; this film is rude, crude and very funny 19 november 2002 | by lambiepie-2 (los angeles, ca) &ndash; see all my reviews when this film first came out, i had no use for it. then i was home sick one day and caught it on cable. i laughed my butt off. this is a crude, rude and down right funny film. it also helped that i grew up near the pennsylvania dutch and plenty of bowling lanes. two seemingly safe areas that the farley brothers attack it without mercy. sometimes it gets down right disgusting and many cannot stomach, but overall, its very funny.bill and woody were funny as anything. the disco-era beginning makes me laugh like crazy. the commercial bill murray does is to die for. this film will offend alot of people, and many references played for humor may make folks feel uncomfortable, but i loved it. if you are easily offended, this is not the film for you. but for everyone else who likes rude, crude and deviously funny -- often at the expense of others kinda humor, this is a gem to see. 32 of 38 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
