(it's interesting to note here that plato may be hollywood's first sympathetic of a gay character.) all of them are driven by internal demons springing from these conflicts.as usual, ray is a remarkably sensitive photographer. and here he proves himself a master of color. there are too many beautiful scenes to mention here, but the planetarium scene (with the recorded voiceover about human loneliness) beginning of the 'chickie run' are both stunning.the film seems divided between claustrophobic nightmares and utopian fantasies. the skewed camera angles of jim's scenes with his parents contrast with the heavenly dream of teenage paradise in the abandoned house. the staircase motif seems to mark several of these transitions.in any case, this is a stunning film by a consummate artist, and should certainly be viewed apart from the distorting lens of the james dean myth. dean, for his part, is remarkable here, although, as i stated above, the performances here are in a style far removed from what today's audiences are accustomed to.it's quite silly to say, as several people have here, that this film's themes are 'dated'. they seem to be the constant themes of youth: idealism vs. cynicism, the turmoil of sexual awakening, the desire to fit in, and the internal violence that constantly threatens to become external. to say that these no longer apply because these kids have never heard of ecstasy or the crips is like saying that &quot;hamlet&quot; no longer rings true because nobody swordfights anymore.my one complaint about this film is with the title. certainly quite dramatic, it sounds more like a marketing tagline than any kind of description of the goings on of this film. jim seems less like a rebel than a young man caught in an inescapable turmoil, and his reaction to the final tragedy belies his lack of a cause. but this is a minor complaint, and i can recommend this film without reservation. 48 of 73 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 290 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: judy's mother goon mil crawford family maid mrs. stark - jim's grandmother helen dr. minton ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
