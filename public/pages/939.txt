frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews ryder and kaminski 26 january 1999 | by james chong (james.chong@xylan.com) (los angeles) &ndash; see all my reviews there are only two reasons to watch this film: winona ryder's wonderful (as usual) performance, and janusz kaminski's spectacular cinematography.ryder breathes life into finn dodd, portraying her as a charming, intelligent, and highly sensitive young woman struggling to define what love and commitment mean to her. ryder is one of those few actresses who is able to relay a world of meaning in just her facial expressions alone. she's mesmerizing to watch onscreen.added to ryder's enchanting performance is academy award winning cinematographer janusz kaminski's beautiful, flowing images. there are many tiresome flashback sequences in this film, but they are all worth seeing just for the artistic value of the photography. kaminski makes wonderful use of fluid camera movements and grainy filters to capture the essence of each time and place portrayed. it's no wonder kaminski won an academy award for his work in schindler's list and will most likely win another for saving private ryan.other than these elements, this film has very little going for it. the screenplay is muddled and jumpy, and there are far too many characters with far too many inconsequential flashback sequences that say very little about the nature of either love or commitment. the story concerns nothing more than a bunch of old women sharing completely one-sided and sexist sob stories. like the joy luck club and waiting to exhale, this film portrays men as little more than duplicitous, moronic, emotionally immature children who are incapable of either expressing true love or loyalty. it is a completely shallow look at adult human relationships and has nothing new or profound to say about anything.as a male supporter of feminism and feminist artistic expression, it saddens me that films like this are, first of all, even made, and then marketed as movies that modern women should see and even cherish. there are many far better films about women and their unique experiences, the most recent one being a small film called high art, written and directed by lisa cholodenko and starring ally sheedy in one of 1998's best performances. 10 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
