trivia the team found it hard to get any of the traditional advertising outlets to promote their film so they hit on the novel (and ultimately successful) idea of putting comic strips on bus benches. this gave the film a certain "street" feel, helping it to become a cult hit. see more &raquo; goofs after cheech picks up chong at the beginning, cheech's ring disappears and reappears and tommy chong's bandana shifts position on his head between shots. see more &raquo; quotes strawberry: ahhh, look at that man, the great outdoors, huh! pedro: yeah, the great outdoors...
