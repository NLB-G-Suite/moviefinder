trivia in luciano's close ups, his right eye is not open as much as the left. on many historical pictures of the real lucky luciano his right eye is partially closed as well. this was due to a knife injury during a 1929 abduction by unknown assailants that damaged muscles in his right cheek that prevented his eye from working properly. see more &raquo; goofs an on-screen title card reads &quot;december, 1934&quot;, and an exterior shot shows a building with green grass surrounding it, and the sun shining brightly. in new york in december, the ground should be covered with snow. in the following scene, dutch schultz is having a meeting while a yankees game is playing on the radio in the background. a baseball game wouldn't be in december! see more &raquo; quotes dutch schultz: i remember the days when you could get a guy hit for 40 bucks. mike salke: we live in inflationary times see more &raquo; connections references bambi&nbsp;(1942) see more &raquo; soundtracks ramrod written by jesse james performed by tony powell see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: is this movie historically accurate?
