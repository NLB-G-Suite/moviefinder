if you do the research you will find that more feature films (bipic and documentary) have been done on ali than any other boxer. fortunately for this review, i have seen them all.how does manny compare, as a film? not very well, i am afraid. it wanders and it lacks focus.if manny boxed like the director of this film directed, he would have knocked out while still a teenager.in fairness, with ali, there was a natural story arc in the way the entire world gave up on him going into the foreman fight, and manny&#x27;s story lacks that central theme.that said, it is still a weakish film. 9 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
