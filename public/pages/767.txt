edit did you know? trivia the movie was supposed to be called "grace under fire", but that was rejected because of grace under fire (1993). so the movie was eventually named after the song "something to talk about", popularized by bonnie raitt. the version in the movie is sung by therese willis. the song was composed by shirley eikhard. see more &raquo;

frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; mediocre movie from lasse hallstr&ouml;m, not on the level we use to watch from him 10 july 2008 | by johnny-08 (rijeka,croatia) &ndash; see all my reviews when it comes to directors like lasse hallstr&ouml;m, i always expect maximum, best, masterpiece. after movies that he made back in finland and brilliant &quot;what&#39;s eating gilbert grape&quot; i think that my expectations were justified. sadly, this movie came just behind gilbert so i can live with one mediocre movie after a huge success with gilbert and then later movie like &quot;the cider house rules&quot;, &quot;chocolat&quot;... hallstr&ouml;m likes to make family movies, where he can expose the whole family with all their pluses and minuses. in this case, story was written by callie khouri (thelma &amp; louise), typical &#39;women are always good&#39; writer. in the middle of the story we&#39;ve got grace bichon (julia roberts), who founds out that her husband eddie (dennis quaid) is unfaithful. with her daughter, she decides to come back home at ranch. there she must face her traditional father wyly (robert duvall) and mother georgia (gena rowlands), who seems to be doing whatever wyly wants. the only person who fully understands her is her sister emma rae (kyra sedgwick).i disagree that there is nothing to talk about in this movie. yes, this movie has some obvious problems: the script is not brilliant which is mostly seen in situations that we&#39;ve all seen before and characters like eddie, wyly and georgia are written on a way that there is nothing for actors to act. but all hallstr&ouml;m characters are alive (you can identify with them) and about family problems that are presented in this movie there is plenty to talk about. for example, what strong woman like grace does when she&#39;s cheated, how to explain her young daughter that her dad isn&#39;t living with them any more; the whole relationship of bichon&#39;s after infidelity. on the other hand, we&#39;ve got relationship between two sisters, between wyly and georgia king and so on. so we&#39;ve got plenty stuff to talk about only if you think about it for a while. what this script lacks is quality writing of male characters. duvall&#39;s and quaid&#39;s characters are simply not developed enough.about acting part, i must admit that julia roberts is very good in this role, just like kyra sedgwick and brett cullen (his character is the only male character that is made right). duvall, rowlands &amp; quaid have nothing to act, like i said before. but i read one comment that says that duvall shouldn&#39;t act in any movie. that is what made me angry so i had to write it. man is a screen and stage legend! so to end, if you can watch this family drama about marriage, infidelity and love. it&#39;s not the best choice coming from hallstr&ouml;m but it&#39;s a bearable one. 6 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
