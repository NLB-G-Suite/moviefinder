edit storyline eve (anne baxter) is waiting backstage to meet her idol, aging broadway star margo channing (bette davis). it seems innocent enough as eve explains that she has seen margo in every performance of her current play. only playwright/critic dewitt (george sanders) sees through eve's evil plan, which is to take her parts and her fiancé, bill simpson (gary merrill). when the fiancé shows no interest, she tries for playwright lloyd richards (hugh marlowe), but dewitt stops her. after she accepts her award, she decides to skip the after-party and goes to her room, where a young woman named phoebe has sneaked into her room and fallen asleep. this is where the "circle of life" now comes to fruition as eve will get played like she played margo. plot summary | plot synopsis plot keywords: starlet | meta film | famous line | title spoken by character | character name in title |&nbsp;see all (198)&nbsp;&raquo;

edit did you know? trivia in an introduction to the film on turner classic movies in november 2008, robert osborne said that everyone assumed that bette davis had based her characterization on tallulah bankhead, even tallulah herself. in fact, bankhead even considered suing twentieth-century fox, but decided not to, because bette davis "did such a good job. i've just been witched out of $1,000,000 by bette being as good as me." but in 1952, tallulah bankhead starred in a radio adaptation of "all about eve" which featured in the supporting cast mary orr, author of the original story "the wisdom of eve". according to robert osborne, during a rehearsal tallulah asked mary orr: "i was the prototype for margo channing, wasn't i?" and orr set the record straight and said "no". tallulah reportedly never spoke to mary orr again. see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; a magnificent timeless tale of ambition, manipulation and betrayal - certainly one of the best classics ever 17 october 2005 | by claudio carvalho (rio de janeiro, brazil) &ndash; see all my reviews the ambitious eve harrington (anne baxter) gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist margo channing (bette davis) and her friends karen richards (celeste holm) and her husband, the play-writer lloyd richards (hugh marlowe); her boyfriend and director bill sampson (gary marrow); and the producer max fabian (gregory ratoff). everybody, except the cynical critic addison dewitt (george sanders), believe that eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of margo and they try to help her. however, eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business.&quot;all about eve&quot; is a magnificent timeless tale of ambition, manipulation and betrayal, and certainly one of the best classics ever. everything perfectly works in this movie: the direction is very precise and tight; dialogs are very acid and intelligent; bette davis, anne baxter, george sanders and celeste holm have awesome performances in very powerful characters; the dramatic story is amazingly good, showing what an evil person can plot to reach fame and success. i believe this movie will always be among my ten favorite movies ever. my vote is ten.title (brazil): &quot;a malvada&quot;
