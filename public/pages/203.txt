user reviews &nbsp; still the cornerstone of all modern anime 8 february 2000 | by cygnus x-1 (roanoke, va) &ndash; see all my reviews i'll admit. compared to the recent crop of anime, the animation in akira seems a bit dated and rough. but when you consider what came before akira, and the profound effect it had on all japanese animators (just look at everything that has come out since that mirrors the same style and themes), this was justifiably groundbreaking stuff when it was originally released.the film is very violent, and if you're an unfortunate soul who thinks that animation begins and ends with disney, your eyes will probably be popping out of your head at some of the images. the plot definately requires the viewer to pay attention since it works with various themes on a lot of different levels to successfully propel the film to it's shocking and over-the-top conclusion.a true classic in every since of the word and a great starting point for people wanting to get into japanese animation. and anyone wanting to see where the current crop of anime is derived from, here it is..........rating:9.5 69 of 88 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
