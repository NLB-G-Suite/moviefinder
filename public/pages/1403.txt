see all my reviews i caught this movie last night on tmc. it premiered soon after i was diagnosed with clinical depression in 93 and even though i was glad to finally have a name to my own madness, i was not ready to see it at that point. many told me about it though and finally, i saw it. it was very, very good. gere did an exceptional job at portraying the classic bipolar i individual. (my depression is 95% lows and have had only one or two manic episodes in my life and am well controlled and on meds). the highs are fun but it is pure payback with the lows. of course, with this being a movie, the dr. falls for mr jones and in the real world, that would lead to termination on her part. in the case of movies though, anything goes and richard gere would be hard not to fall for, lol. everyone did an exceptional job and it was an exceptional movie. kudos to all! 10 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 34 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: mr. jones libbie dr. catherine holland patrick howard david amanda susan mr. wilson dr. rosen judge harris bellboy son daughter ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
