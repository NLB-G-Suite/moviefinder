frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; surprisingly involving portrait of a questionable man 11 may 2013 | by jjnxn-1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews in many ways wallace was a reprehensible man so a three hour film of his rather infamous life should be a struggle to get through, that its not is almost wholly because it has such a high quality cast. clarence williams iii offers quiet support in the difficult role of wallace&#x27;s long time servant and the many familiar faces that are in support all are fine in their various roles. the real spotlight is on the three main characters and its here that the film really delivers.mare winningham is both strong and soft as lurleen wallace standing by her man who is devoted to her. their relationship does much to humanize wallace. angelina jolie, during the very brief period of her career spent in tv, is equally strong as cornelia wallace showing that she was more than the trophy wife she was sometimes painted. even with all this excellent work the film would be nothing without a knockout lead actor and gary sinise is that. he is totally committed to the character whether showing his bigotry or his humanity, a splendid piece of work. frankenheimer&#x27;s direction is sure handed keeping the interest level high as he moves through a most complicated man&#x27;s life. 8 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
