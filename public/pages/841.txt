&quot;no.&quot; you're against it? &quot;i did not say that.&quot; robb then offers a reply which completely dodges the question and walks off.north is a smoother politician, but you still don't trust his smile. he makes the requisite church appearance, endorses jesus, and tells the people it's such a relief to talk about something besides politics-as if his running for senator has nothing to do with why he is speaking at this church. i only came here this morning because i'm christian just like you, he wants them to believe.we see north tell college students that he never lied to congress. when asked how he feels about the potentially racist implications of flying a confederate flag, north makes the suspicious claim that he recently saw robb wearing a confederate necktie. as this happens a reporter backstage tells a north strategist that this claim sounds fishy, north's helper responds with a shrug. apparently he's not the least bit disturbed that his candidate may have just told a blatant lie.there is a lot of footage of north's campaign strategists. at one point we see one person privately admitting that politics only offer entertainment. but &quot;what we are not offering are solutions...not us, not not anybody.&quot; it's almost refreshing for somebody to come right out and admit it.if you are tired of two-faced politicians and their ever-present vague promises of &quot;change&quot;, you need to track this movie down. it is honest, and good for a laugh. 12 of 13 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
