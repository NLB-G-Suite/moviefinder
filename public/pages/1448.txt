see all my reviews i personaly really liked this movie ,i thought stephen dorff was great this movie got me interested in him and his other movies!i like the plot its different and doesnt really hide anything its better for a younger crowd 15-21 it can be related to easily by them as it contains a lot of anger and confusion the catch frase is &quot;so f*****g what&quot; which tries to make us c that nothing really matters ! the characters are all put together pretty good except reese witherspoon's character wendy did get on my nerves a bit she just didnt seem right for the part! i recommend this movie i really liked it ,it also has great music in it ranging from hole ,maralyn mason and soundgarden . 5 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
