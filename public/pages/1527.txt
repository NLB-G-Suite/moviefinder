edit storyline in the alpine village of tolzbad in the 1800s, the townsfolk talk quietly and restrain their movements lest they incur avalanches. this atmosphere lends itself to repressed emotions - shown through the parallel stories of butler student johann lusting after his mother (an old flame of the mysterious count knotkers) and klara's attraction to her father (who lusts after his other daughter), leading to duels and suicidal plunges galore. all this is shot in the style of an early german sonal film, complete with intertitles, crackly sound-track and 'hand-tinted' colour effects. written by michael brooke &lt;michael@everyman.demon.co.uk&gt;

see all my reviews i saw the film careful and i loved the cinematography of this film. so many different techniques of photography and color correction were used in the film. i learned more about german expressionism. i feel that a lot of films stick with the three act structure but this was something different. it was unusual and beautiful. it has a strong story which deals with love and jealousy. a mother&#x27;s love for the sons is explored in the form of art. i praise the filmmaker for being brave and daring to make a film like this. the actors were very strong and the story kept me intrigued along with the unusual and unique cinematography. great job! 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
