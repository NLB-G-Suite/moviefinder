trivia idabel thompkins was based on harper lee who, in turn, modeled the character of dill in to kill a mockingbird (1962) on writer truman capote. see more &raquo; quotes joel sansom: idabell said there was a traveling fair in the next town to noon city: we could cut through the swamp and hitch a ride with them. we'd go to california and get jobs picking grapes and find a preacher to marry us. see more &raquo; soundtracks la fleur que tu m'avais jetté from &quot;carmen&quot; composed by georges bizet tenor: enrico caruso see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; early truman capote work finally makes its way to film and video 5 april 2000 | by gonzalo melendez (gonz30) (rio de janeiro, brazil) &ndash; see all my reviews other voices, other rooms was truman capote's first novel. it was later adapted for the stage, and a few years ago, finally made into a film obviously destined to video. since the film's final format appears to have been known from day one, it is no wonder it has the feel of a tv movie. this is fine, since now it is the way you are going to see it, and on pal video only, almost three years after its initial release. this typically capote southern gothic drama set in the 30's, is about a young man played by david speck who goes in search of his ailing father. the father is being cared for by an eccentric pair of cousins, anne thomson and an outrageous lothaire bluteau. bluteau, (jesus of montreal, bent,) arguably canada's best character actor, tackles another challenging role successfully, and is in my opinion the only reason to see this film other than the capote curiosity factor. the quebecois actor, whose fluent english has nevertheless always sported his quebec origins, has difficulties with a southern accent. but his ample acting abilities and over the top characterization of what is best described as a male blanche dubois, still bring the most appealing aspects of this film to life. 8 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
