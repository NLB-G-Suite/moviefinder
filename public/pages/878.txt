life is an orange 24 september 2003 | by valadas (portugal) &ndash; see all my reviews in this excellent movie we are told an apparently very simple story where life meets death, success crosses with failure, conjugal life redounds in adultery and love triumphs over it all though in a somewhat strange way. a man's best friend is dying of aids. he comes to visit him and that fact unchains a lot of coincidences and accidental events which will change some people's lives. this story is really made of factual coincidences but this circumstance far from being a flaw, is its backbone since life itself is full of strange coincidences and those shown here are not improbable. life is really an orange like the dying man tells his best friend in his deathbed. what does this mean indeed? the answer is not given in the movie so it's up to you to find it by yourself. another very important feature of the plot is the solid friendship between these two men which is revealed by some very moving deeds and circumstances. one last word for the sound track music which is also excellent and adequate to the atmosphere of the movie thus reinforcing it and making us feel it more deeply. and one last warning: prudes, abstain from seeing this movie because you will hate it not so much for certain scenes (as a matter of fact we have seen a lot of more explicit ones in a lot of famous movies) but because you won't be able to lay your moral prejudice aside in order to admire the beauty of this true love story or to understand its rather odd end. is it important to say that the lovers' couple is here composed of a black man and a white woman (wesley snipes and nastassja kinski who perform their roles very well)? i don't think so. 9 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
