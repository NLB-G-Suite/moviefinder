this is one mean story 7 january 2006 | by ccthemovieman-1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews now here's a film with a mean edge....very mean....almost too mean. if i didn't like christopher walken (and who doesn't?) i wouldn't have watched this low- life trash. but walken makes the trash fashionable somehow. plus, i always like looking at great nighttime shots of new york city.a nice job of restoration was done on this latest two-disc dvd. the film finally looks good. this is stylishly filmed, too.story-wise, as mentioned, it's very rough, lots of f-words, and a simple story of a crime boss who is released from jail and is trying to reclaim his hold on the city's mob scene.it's an interesting cast. besides walken is a trio of actors who wound up becoming stars: david caruso (a tv star), lawrence fishburne and wesley snipes. all of them are nasty, too. sometimes they make walken look good in comparison. unfortunately, two of those guys are cops and filmmakers love to make the cops into unlikable bad guys. they certainly are here.so, if you're feeling ornery and want to take out some hostility without hurting anyone or anything, just flip this disc in your dvd and it should be what the doctor ordered. if you can relate to any of these people in this movie, call a minister, priest, rabbi or psychiatrist. you need help. 35 of 55 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
