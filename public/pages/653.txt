trivia the 1980s were a tumultuous time in poland. workers' strikes in gdansk led to the formation of the solidarity movement. in 1980 lech walesa was elected chairman of this reform movement. the red and white solidarity logo became an international icon that literally wrapped itself around the city, creating a visual momentum that led to a political revolution. once again, posters played a pivotal role in defining the future. in 1989, the day before the country was to vote on the political future of poland, a poster featuring an image of gary cooper from this film was plastered on kiosks and walls around the country. this landmark image of the famous actor strolling towards the viewer depicted him carrying not a gun, but a voting ballot, and wearing a solidarity logo above his sheriff's badge that read, "it's high noon, june 4, 1989." as frank fox, former professor of eastern european history, stated, "indeed, an american western was an apt symbol for a political duel that marked the beginning of the end of communism in eastern europe. gary cooper would have approved." see more &raquo; goofs in the climactic crane shot when kane is alone in the town square, high-voltage power lines and poles are clearly visible in the skyline. see more &raquo; quotes deputy sheriff herb baker: [when herb volunteer's to be will's first and only deputy sheriff for posse, herb remarks to will] i'll be back in ten minutes, loaded for bear. see more &raquo; connections featured in big guns talk: the story of the western&nbsp;(1997) see more &raquo; soundtracks high noon ballad by dimitri tiomkin lyrics by ned washington sung by tex ritter played often in the score see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how much sex, violence, and profanity are in this movie?

can anyone find a single flaw in this movie? any way it could have been better? this is the gold standard by which westerns should be measured, not to mention any drama. it simply doesn&#39;t get any better than this.as film, high noon does an exceptional job of giving depth to characters quickly. the situation defines their character. katy jurado&#39; role is one of the exceptions, where there is more talking, but we see unfold an exceptionally interesting person. how many movies can you watch repeatedly over the years as you grow up and grow old that continue to move you and continue to reveal new depth and meaning? that is the measure of art.this movie is timeless, and has a lesson for humanity of all eras and all nationalities. it will be watched a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now, if civilization survives that long. the message of this film is that this is not at all certain. it is up to us.i suspect the reason some people down-rate high noon is not for the quality of the film, but the message. like john wayne, they just don&#39;t like what it says about america. well i&#39;ve got bad news for you, john, the frank millers have killed the sheriff and now run this country. the gang has gotten elected president and vice president. and the townspeople and ministers acquiesced like sheep or even actively supported it as &quot;good for business.&quot; 69 of 104 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
