trivia filmed in atlanta, most of the abandoned buildings seen in the film were slated for demolition to make way for facilities for the 1996 olympics. see more &raquo; goofs dr. lazarus tells fleck that robocop is essentially murphy and that parts of murphy&#39;s face, cerebrum and cerebellum were used to create robocop. this contradicts information from the first movie, robocop. even though the first movie does not go into detail on how much of murphy&#39;s body parts were used to make robocop, the fact that he needed a rudimentary paste (that tasted like baby food) to &quot;sustain his organic system&quot; would imply that robocop would at least have a (albeit simplified) digestive system of some kind. see more &raquo; quotes robocop: [with flamethrower arm in police station] you may want to call the fire department.
