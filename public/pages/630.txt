user reviews &nbsp; probably the best historical movie ever 23 october 2008 | by luther-32 (united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews set in early renaissance arriege, this movie is truly as masterpiece. don&#39;t be put off by subtitles, just enjoy. depardieu is superb, one of his best performances...truly amazing! the story: bertrande de rolls&#39;s husband, martin guerre disappeared sometime ago. she remained faithful, until arnaud du tilh, appears and pretends to be the returning martin guerre.if, like me, you like both, movies and history, you must watch that masterpiece. the costumes, the settings, the decors, peasant life... all made to recreate a corner of french renaissance countryside.the story is based on facts, on real events. it&#39;s a true story, slightly changed and without the catholic-protestant antagonism. what a brilliant movie!!! like to know more? read natalie zemon davis&#39;&quot;the return of martin guerre&quot;
