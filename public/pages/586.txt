frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; an engaging made-for-video thriller! 11 march 2015 | by olliesuave-007 (california, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews i saw this made-for-video movie on tv once and was quite impressed with it. it stars alicia silverstone as mary giordano, a student who has an addiction to mystery novels and detective magazines. she uses her knowledge of detective work to intervene in a homicide case, and teams up with police cadet tony campbell (kevin dillon) to try to solve it.the chemistry between mary and tony were good and the movie has a good thrilling and exhilarating feel to it. for a made-for-video movie, the script made for an exciting plot and kept me engaged, especially when he came to the part when mary finds herself becoming a victim of her own circumstances.while the plot may be predictable, it does go at a steady momentum and the acting throughout wasn&#x27;t bad. overall, this makes for a good movie to keep you entertained on a slow night.grade b 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
