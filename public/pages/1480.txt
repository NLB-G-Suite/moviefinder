frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; dream for my father 15 october 2007 | by aberjam2006 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i have a special place for this movie, as my father had a bit part in the film as the bartender playing the glasses while david arquette dances on the bar. my dad passed away exactly one year ago today from cancer, and i wanted to give him a little shout out on here, as this film is indicative of how he spent the last days of his life. apparently the filmmakers hung out in the bar my dad worked at while they were filming this, and saw him play the glasses as such, and decided to put in the 20 sec scene on a whim. they also got his last name completely wrong in the credits. it&#39;s engel, not ingalls. but nonetheless, it&#39;s a wonderful and moving film that i would recommend highly. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
