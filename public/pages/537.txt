edit did you know? trivia many at disney had high hopes for the movie upon initial release. then-studio head jeffrey katzenberg regarded it as a more prestigious project than the lion king (1994), and even believed that it had a chance of earning an academy award nomination for "best picture", following in the steps of beauty and the beast (1991). however, the movie was less successful commercially than was hoped. the film still got good reviews and did suceed in the box office, but because the film dealt with more adult themes and tones, it did not appeal to younger children as much as earlier disney hits had. see more &raquo;
