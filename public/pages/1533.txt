edit storyline during the american civil war, a union army captain leads his rag-tag cavalry troop up a misty creek to a remote farm to appropriate enemy (confederate) livestock. the farm is worked by sarah anders, whose husband is away fighting for the confederate army. far from the great armies and battlefields, a very private civil war erupts. the captain and sarah are pulled apart by the war's undertow into choices they can not fully control or understand. each character in this drama must decide whether loyalty will be paid in blood. this story has a relevance to current partisan conflicts. armies are not filled with murdering psychopaths. good people can be driven to do bad things. the story chronicles the pathology of war, how escalating events can trigger unasked-for tragedy. based on a true story about a southern child who shot and killed a union soldier during the civil war. written by &lt;jstanley@stern.nyu.edu&gt;

see all my reviews this film was my first acquaintance with the talents of chris cooper. i was deeply impressed with the character he played. i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor. he plays a union captain who, along with a couple of enlisted men, are foraging in eastern kentucky. they happen upon the farm of a &quot;sesech&quot; woman whose husband has chosen to go off to the confederacy. the portrayal of eastern kentucky, and its seriously divided sentiments during the war, is so very accurate. if you are looking for a war film with a lot of blood and guts, this would not be it. if you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of peoples at war, actually and philosophically, then this is the best study of how divided loyalties affected the interaction of peoples in the border states during america&#39;s civil war. 3 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
