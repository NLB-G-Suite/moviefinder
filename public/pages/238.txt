trivia the film was originally scheduled for a summer 1992 release, as the teaser posters said, but when michael mann's first version clocked in at three hours, he was told by fox to cut the film down and the release was postponed to september. mann was never happy with the resulting two-hour version, feeling he had not had enough time to properly trim it, and so fox allowed him to re-edit it entirely for the 1999 dvd release. although only a few minutes longer, the new version features minor changes throughout the film. it is mann's preferred version and the only one available on dvd in the us. see more &raquo; goofs just before chingachgook gives magua the final blow. the shot shows magua standing upright, the next shot just before chingachgook hits him he's already bending over. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] title card: 1757 / the american colonies. / it is the 3rd year of the war between england and france for the possession of the continent. / three men, the last of a vanishing people, are on the frontier west of the hudson river. see more &raquo; connections referenced in ban the sadist videos! part 2&nbsp;(2006) see more &raquo; soundtracks i will find you written and produced by ciarán brennan performed by clannad courtesy of atlantic records see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what's the rifle used by hawkeye?
