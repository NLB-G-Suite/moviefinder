black comedy, folks (and a very good one too) 18 may 2003 | by cyclonev (perth, western australia) &ndash; see all my reviews i enjoyed dib and don't have much to add to the other positive reviews posted, however i just had to comment on the couple of reviews questioning whether it was a comedy. if you don't understand and enjoy black comedy then don't watch a black comedy and expect to enjoy it! surely the title should give you a pretty good clue as to whether you're going to like it or not. if you find the idea of death/grim subjects innately unfunny then switch off!i find it tremendously sad, but not surprising, that there are so many people in the world who can't find something funny unless it's &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;nice&quot;. what a loss for them. oh well, all the more for the rest of us! 6 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 19 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
