trivia the team working on the movie was supposedly disney's "team b," who were "kept busy" while "team a" worked on pocahontas (1995), on which the production had much higher hopes. as it turned out, the lion king became a huge critical and commercial success, whereas pocahontas met with mixed reviews and a much lower box office. see more &raquo; goofs disappearing tree/rock - when the wildebeest herd starts to stampede through the valley, simba is first on top of the rock that is under the tree, in the valley. the next scene then shows simba standing out in the open floor of the valley as the wildebeests come running at him, and now there is no tree or rock anywhere to be seen. then as simba is shown running away from the wildebeests, we can see the tree and rock in the background again. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] scar: [scar catches a mouse] life's not fair, is it?
