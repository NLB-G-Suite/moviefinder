frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews mira sorvino 11 august 1999 | by kate &ndash; see all my reviews the writing, directing, and acting in this movie were fabulous. the supporting cast is one of the best ever assembled, and heading this supporting cast is the breakout performance of the century. mira sorvino as linda ash has to be one of the greatest comedic performances in the history of film. she is charming, and sweet, and everything you would never expect a new york hooker and porn star to be. she creates linda ash from lines and direction that could go either way. she could have chosen to make this character a hardened, tough city chick. instead, she went a completely different route of innocence despite sexual experience and naivete in the face of new york attitude, and it won her a well-deserved oscar. she is also just as delightful and funny as she is touching and poignant. see this movie, even if it is only for sorvino's performance, ignoring the incredible and novel script, the presence of helena bonham carter and other actors of her caliber, and the fact that this could rival annie hall for best woody allen film. great acting, great script, great comedy, wonderful movie. 12 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
