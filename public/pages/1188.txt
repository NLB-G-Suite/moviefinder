user reviews &nbsp; kirk and liz challenge jack and louise... 8 february 2008 | by isaac5855 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews amos was a surprisingly effective tv-movie which owes a lot to one flew over the cuckoo&#39;s nest, but stands on its own as competent little shocker. kirk douglas, who ironically starred in cuckoo&#39;s nest on broadway, plays the title role here, a cantankerous senior citizen who finds himself committed to a senior citizens facility that is run by an iron-fisted nurse (elizabeth montgomery)who amos suspects is over stepping the bounds of her authority by physically abusing the clients and robbing them of their life savings. stanley gordon west&#39;s strong teleplay is an asset,but what makes this film sizzle is the cat and mouse game between amos and the head nurse, who montgomery bone-chillingly brings to life in one of her best performances, burying her samantha stephens image forever. strong support is also provided by screen veterans dorothy mcguire, pat morita, and ray walston but it is the emmy-nominated performances by douglas and montgomery that are the main selling points here. it&#39;s no cuckoo&#39;s nest, but it is an entertaining second cousin. 8 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
