what part of: &quot;this is a children's film&quot; don't you understand? 26 january 2005 | by aimless-46 (kentucky) &ndash; see all my reviews hard to figure the negative comments about this film. it is geared to an elementary school audience who will find it very entertaining. but it is also good family viewing because the scenery is terrific and the polar bear cub is very cute. since there was never a conspiracy to keep the demographic identity of the target audience a national secret, those complaining about its lack of sophistication were just too lazy to check it out before actually viewing it. the film delivers exactly what it promises so there is no real basis for that kind of criticism.the editing is first class; especially on the canoe down the rapids sequence where the second unit stuff is perfectly cut into tight shots of the two stars. thora birch turns in another excellent performance and vincent kartheiser shows that even before &quot;angel&quot; he modeled his acting on william shatner (this is not a complement).there are a number of plot holes but nothing that really matters. one interesting thing is the scene where the bear cub helps in the rescue effort by pulling the rope with his teeth. seldom can you point to a &quot;single&quot; stupid detail that drastically dumbs down a film but that is the case here. lose that one moronic shot and the film gains about 20 iq points and could add a couple years to its target audience. 10 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
