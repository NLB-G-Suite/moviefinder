user reviews &nbsp; if a movie touches you 26 december 2005 | by juerghofer (switzerland) &ndash; see all my reviews like this one, a 10 is all you can do. tom is great, meg the woman plays the woman's role like nobody else could have.....if i get tears in a movie, the movie is a m o v i e ........touching. thank you folks who did it, the folks who wrote this wonderful story. am i sentimental? yess. and it feels good. each turn of the story makes you wish, hope, and finally no violence in a movie. what a relief. if you watch this movie around x-mas, you probable get more sentimental than in a hot summer night, i don't no. it took me 12 years to get to see this movie. heard so much and everything i heard was an understatement. thank you tom and meg and specially ross, love you. 36 of 61 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
