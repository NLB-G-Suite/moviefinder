tremendous cast, good, but not great, historical narrative 15 august 2003 | by elainew32 (wausau, wisconsin) &ndash; see all my reviews in a way, it seems like a waste to gather matthew mcconaughey, ethan hawke, skeet ulrich, and vincent d'onofrio for this movie, because they should've been able to do something great, although, if it weren't for them, it would have been boring. it is a straightforward assembly of the facts of the incredible run of 80 bank robberies by the newton brothers. then they go for the big one, a train robbery of federal reserve funds. it is entertaining, but i was most entertained during the running of the credits. over to the left, they show clips of joe newton at about age 79, on johnny carson's tonight show, interspersed with film clips of an interview with willis newton in his 80's, both giving their views of what it was like and how they felt about what they had done. after seeing hollywood's version of their lives, it was interesting to see what they were like in old age. 8 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
