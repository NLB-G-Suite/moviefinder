(sat46@corecomm.net) &ndash; see all my reviews the mid fifties television production of walt disney's &quot;davy crockett&quot; struck a nerve in the physic of american children. this three part tv mini-series launched the &quot;davy crockett craze&quot;, a phenomena that swept the nation for some time.davy crockett collecting cards, coonskin caps, toys, other assorted memorabilia, and the ever popular recording of the &quot;ballad of davy crockett&quot;, were only some of the outward signs of it's vast popularity. actors, fess parker, as davy crockett, and buddy ebson as his sidekick, georgie russell became popular with almost most every child in america, practically over night. the show was so successful that the original three part series was clipped together and released to theaters as a full length movie. then the disney studio produced a two part tv sequel the following year.there is little doubt that by today's standards there was nothing special about it's plot, or dialog, or the acting, etc. some critics might go as far to say it was rather silly, childish, and a mediocre production at best.perhaps that's all true, but it would miss the most important point. seldom has any tv production cause so many young people to love a couple of screen characters so deeply, and with such spontaneous joy. in this regard it is a classic and holds a special place in the history of television art. 10 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 31 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: gen. thimblerig maj. tobias norton chief red stick polly crockett busted luck bigfoot mason charlie two shirts swaney bruno ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
