trivia when fresh comes over to his dad's (sam's) trailer, sam (samuel l. jackson), who's a drunk ,a chess hustler, and down in the dumps, tells fresh (sean nelson) "welcome to the taj mahal". samuel l. jackson used that, as a parody to his role as a homeless crackhead, in spike lee's jungle fever (1991), where westley snipe's character searches for sam jackson's "gator" in a crackhouse. when westley, who played flipper, finally finds gator, hears the same comment about the taj mahal. see more &raquo; goofs in the final scene at the park, the same blonde girl walks behind fresh twice (the first time just as he makes it to the chess table, then again once he has sat down; by then the girl, walking at an uninterrupted pace, should've been out of the shot). see more &raquo; quotes james: you michael, huh?
