trivia the film was shot in western marin county, california. director john carpenter had a house in inverness for several years, so the location was essentially his second home at that time (as the director puts it, "his own backyard"). however, the locals were not happy to see the film crew in the area so they made the shoot very difficult by harassment and vandalism. carpenter tells that while they were filming, for example, a sound take, a neighbor would start mowing his lawn or start up a chainsaw until he was paid to stop. some of the people even tried to break into the equipment trucks. the whole experience essentially soured carpenter on living in the area, where several scenes of his earlier film the fog (1980) were also filmed. see more &raquo; goofs baby mara, has dark brown eyes, older mara has light blue eyes. see more &raquo; quotes mara chaffee: the eyes are the windows to the soul. see more &raquo; connections featured in the go to guy: peter jason on john carpenter&nbsp;(2016) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; great movie 7 december 2004 | by benoit cote (canada) &ndash; see all my reviews john carpenter 1995 remake of the classic village of the damned is also a classic. whatever what people may have say, this movie is awesome. the late great christopher reeve acting are amazing. its just sad to know that its is last movie before his horrible horse accident. but reeve is not the best actor in the movie. i would give that title to lindsey haun. lindsey acting as mara, the leading child is simply amazing. this version is, in my opinion, way better than the original 1960 movie. a lot of people wont agree here thought...i totally recommend that movie, since its my 3rd all time favorite (first being 1982 poltergeist and second, 1986 aliens). i give village of the damned, a 10/10 43 of 76 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
