user reviews &nbsp; a great fantasy-comedy 7 may 2005 | by drevil1985 (romania) &ndash; see all my reviews i am very upset that most people take this movie too seriously this movie is just a nice comedy with a very intriguing subject. most people try to find bug in this movie but i believe that they should just sit back and enjoy the great epic line. let's be serious do you believe that a galaxy can be carried around a cat's belt or that &quot;elivs is not dead he's just gone home&quot; ? for this reason i believe this is an excellent comedy with a sf theme. i also appreciate that the acting is very good and the script is very nicely written. i urge people to stop taking the &quot;noisy cricket&quot; too serious! this movie is making fun of the people who take this sort of things too seriously. 30 of 35 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 295 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
