user reviews &nbsp; tries hard... 28 june 2007 | by frank markland (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews bruce willis returns as john mcclane who this time faces off against mercenaries who have taken over an airport and are threatening to have all the plane crashes, mcclane&#39;s wife holly(bonnie bedelia) is on one such plane and so it&#39;s mcclane back in action as he ponders how the same thing can happen to the same guy twice. die hard 2 to tell you the truth was a mixed bag. on one hand it had lots of action and a brutal edge to the action but also lacks the suspense of the first. in either case though die hard 2 is not bad as sequels go. indeed even though it&#39;s directed by renny harlin, die hard 2 works in-spite of itself. the only flaw is that the movie is feels too much like a carbon copy of the first film only with a bigger is better approach to the stunts. that being said this is a minor flaw to behold and one really doesn&#39;t understand the mixed reaction to this film, when the movie is overall very entertaining.* * * out of 4-(good) 26 of 36 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
