great, light hearted social commentary 9 february 2006 | by gdeangel (chicago, il) &ndash; see all my reviews i saw this film originally in 1999 with with an italian 101 class. my recollection was that the film told of the tribulations of a bunch of ruffian italian school kids who are given hope by an idealist teacher (a familiar theme, think &quot;stand and deliver&quot;, &quot;teachers&quot;, etc.) however, on recently watching it again, i was impressed with how the story is really a very unique social commentary on northern and southern italy in the pre-eu days.the plights of the south are conveyed in third-grader's essays, showing how children absorb the environment, but retain the innocence that could make it possible for them to turn out all right. as an instructional italian film, you are bound to be overwhelmed by some of the most colorful phrases imaginable for swearing at people. but they are all delivered by 9-year-olds who, with their creative gestures, can clearly be seen as recordings of their own observations of adults.this film may not be as socially relevant as it was in 1999, since the euro and free trade have transformed much of europe. but with italy's economic status being regarded as presently unstable, i think this film is worth watching even today. you'll laugh as you are appalled at the same time by the children's view of the world around them. it is a theme that could be applied to the children of any oppressed culture. 5 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
