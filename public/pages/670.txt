4 march 2008 | by spikeopath (united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews well this is just a very average film stuffed full of the usual mainstream disaster genre clich&#xe9;s. even myself as a staunch defender of the genre can not bring myself to rate it above average, because sadly it is something of a wasted opportunity. the film&#x27;s cast is full of very reliable and solid performers, the budget was there to bring out some daring sequences, and of course the basic community in peril plot is always one of interest. so to get anything from this film you really do have to check the brain at the door and suspend all belief because the writers have rewritten the laws of gravity and the intensity of molten lava in full flow.the film would compete with dante&#x27;s peak in the same year for the title of best volcano disaster film, it lost, but so did the fans of the genre. for even today we are still waiting for a volcano based film to grip and excite us, because even with the advance of technology both 1997 volcano movies teeter on the brink of boredom, even if they just about fail to actually tip into the abyss. 5/10 9 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
