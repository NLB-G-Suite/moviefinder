a near-great comedienne ups the ante on this one 14 march 2006 | by martin bradley (moscarbradley@aol.com) (derry, ireland) &ndash; see all my reviews there are millions of comedies like &quot;private benjamin&quot;. they are like tv shows that turn out the same joke week after week, (and &quot;private benjamin&quot; itself turned into a tv show). the best ones work and stay in the memory, not because the jokes are great, (though sometimes they are), but because the players are good and can develop the characters beyond the mere limitations of the gag. (&quot;frasier&quot; and &quot;the golden girls&quot; fall into this category).the jokes in &quot;private benjamin&quot; are not particularly original but they are funny, and they are funny because there is a near-great comedienne at the heart of howard zieff's film. with the right director goldie hawn's kookie, goof-ball wooziness was just about perfect and zieff brings it out. her character is the kind of woman who needs a good shaking, (bette davis would have made mincemeat out of her), but you love her all the same. at least until she starts making a fool of herself with armand assante's french sleaze-ball and the film loses it's comic momentum.there is at least one other grand-standing comic turn from eileen brennan as hawn's drill sergeant. brennan's like a slightly butcher mae west, (i think we're meant to assume she's a lesbian), and she gives her lines the kind of inflection that west did. between them they raise the ante on this one. 7 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 59 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: teddy benjamin harriet benjamin pvt. mary lou glass 1st sgt. jim ballard yale goodman rabbi vocalist at wedding bandleader arnie mr. waxman photographer ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
