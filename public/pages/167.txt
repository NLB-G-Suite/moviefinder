claymation spectacular 5 december 2002 | by dockelektro (portugal) &ndash; see all my reviews a prodigy of animation, &quot;the wrong trousers&quot; won the oscar for best animated short. nick park is at fine shape here, as he displays not only the skill of his craft but also a narrative coherence and care that nearly overpasses the artistic talent. it's the advantage of stop-motion animation: each shot is carefully studied and considered, and the story moves forward having gromit the dog as the main character, and he succeeds all the way in convincing us of his &quot;acting skills&quot;, even though he doesn't say one word or make one sound. the film has a great plot: wallace and gromit are forced to let a room, and a grim penguin applies for it. soon, the intruder takes over the house and replaces gromit as wallace's best friend. but there is more than meets the eye, and the rest of the story is too good to be spoiled. constructing suspense to the very end, with hair-raising sequences until the last spectacular showdown and applying all the formulae that make a god movie, this is animation on the top of its game, and a great opportunity to see just how much you can raise the bar on claymation short features. talent has never been so evident. 19 of 21 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
