see all my reviews before she won an oscar, mira sorvino starred in this small but powerful movie about a guy whose seemingly perfect world comes crashing down when he enters the drug trade. michael imperioli, who played spider in &quot;goodfellas,&quot; has a leading role here and does an outstanding job of portraying down-and-out drug dealer and user angel, but never allows us to dislike him. throughout his struggle we are right by angel's side.even the ending is not obvious: there is no happy finale, but somehow we know he is on the long road back. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
