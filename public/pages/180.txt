user reviews &nbsp; a masterpiece exposing misguided loyalties and greed 5 september 2005 | by smilingron (worcs, uk) &ndash; see all my reviews scorcese &amp; pileggi's masterpiece on the life of henry hill as a brooklyn ny mob wise-guy. as much as the true events of henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this film imo is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.the sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect &amp; principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a &quot;wiseguy&quot;, breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.an example is de niro's portrayal of jimmy conway. his outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. but really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. i use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles. interesting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. i personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. some people have actually paid to see the dukes of hazzard film, so i shouldn't be surprised. 162 of 265 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
