user reviews &nbsp; near perfection. 1 april 2002 | by j. phillips (smashattack) (colorado) &ndash; see all my reviews dragonheart is an excellent movie. the cgi of draco is superb, especially for its time, and the storyline is well thought out. although the movie lacks a decent antagonist, the plot fills in for whatever einon lacks in his role.draco is such an excellent character, possibly one of my favorites of all-time in films. he is exactly what a dragon should be, exactly how i imagined. quaid does an excellent job as bowen, and did well as draco was not really there during filming.the music in dragonheart is one of the most memorable themes ever composed. randy edelman composed a great theme for this film, which could probably be recognized by nearly anybody. &quot;this is from dragonheart!&quot;this is definitely one of the best movies ever made. the acting is excellent, cgi fits perfectly, the characters are deep, well-rounded, and the storyline and plotline are both great. the ending is so sad, though. if you're a male, make sure no one else is around while watching this movie if you're ashamed of crying in front of people.watch this movie. it's a great way to spend some time. 28 of 34 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
