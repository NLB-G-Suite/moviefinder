young actor alex linz who plays alex in home alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. the crooks include three men and one female, and i like that they added a woman into that villain role. they all are good actors and add plenty to this movie.the best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially david thornton as &#x27;unger&#x27;. there are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with alex&#x27;s older brother and sister who &#x22;torment&#x22; him. another flaw was the actual &#x22;home alone&#x22; bit, and the fact that alex isn&#x27;t really home alone as we&#x27;ve seen in the first two films. his mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from chicken pox, hardly the same as kevin mccallister went through. and i don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t take place on christmas. but those drawbacks don&#x27;t take away from the whole movie at all. home alone 3 isn&#x27;t great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. these aren&#x27;t your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. i recommend home alone 3 for sure!6/10 7 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
