edit storyline it's the last day of school, and max wants to catch the eye of roxanne, one of the more attractive girls in school. but how can you be cool when your dad's goofy? stage an impromptu concert at the final assembly, that's how! or at least it sounded good until principal mazer found out. goofy finds out about his son's antics (sort of), and decides a fishing trip, like his dad took him on, is the solution. of course, he doesn't know that max finally lands a date with roxanne for a party thrown by the class valedictorian. through the movie, goofy tries to bring max out of his shell, while max resents being taken away, and lying to roxanne about the trip (he tells her he & his dad will be appearing on tv at the powerline concert in la). will max sink or swim? will goofy goof up his son's first shot at romance? will bigfoot step back? and what about those nuns? written by joe sewell &lt;jsewell@iu.net&gt;

user reviews &nbsp; pretty solid 25 december 2001 | by stamper (the netherlands) &ndash; see all my reviews goofy has always been one of my most favorite disney characters and i always found it a shame he had no feature length film (like mickey mouse whom i really do not like that much). in 1995 though goofy got his feature length film, but it took me until now to see it. it was not for rent here, but i was lucky enough to catch an english spoken version on it on german tv (films on german tv are usually overdubbed in german) so i was very happy to have caught it. i was not let down, neither by disney, nor by goofy. the movie was not as good as the disney movies who are targeted for big audiences, but i still liked it quite a lot. the story was pretty realistic and good, there were enough laughs, but also some &#145;emotional' moments. all in all, something of everything and something for everybody. from me, that gets a: 7 out of 10 16 of 17 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
