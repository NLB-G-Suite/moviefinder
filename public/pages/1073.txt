ridiculous plot, but good fighting 30 october 2006 | by gridoon &ndash; see all my reviews the first 30 minutes of &quot;bloodsport ii&quot; are just plain ridiculous: a sort of &quot;karate kid (or is it karate grownup?) in prison&quot;, with a cut-rate olivier gruner (who is, in turn, a cut-rate van damme!) as the student and a cut-rate miyagi as his teacher (actually, the real miyagi, pat morita, is also in the cast!). daniel bernhardt shows little screen presence here, but it&#39;s his acting debut, so i guess he can be forgiven. but when the movie starts concentrating on the fighting it becomes quite good, with enough variety of styles among the different tournament participants to keep things interesting (there are even some submission victories, somewhat rare for this type of movie). fighting female fans should note the presence of lisa mccullough as the only woman fighter on board; she definitely knows her stuff.
