trivia according to his book "if chins could kill: confessions of a b-movie actor", bruce campbell mentioned that mchale's crew were rarely given specific instructions in many scenes other than to follow tom arnold around. he and french stewart were not given any direction at all for their sequence in the talent show, so they scripted out a vaudeville act using naval and nautical terms all by themselves. despite this, most of their sequence ended up playing in the background while the camera focused on arnold and debra messing. see more &raquo; goofs during the climactic sea battle vladikov is talking into the back of his radio microphone. see more &raquo; quotes willie: [looking at binghampton] hey happy, ain't that the guy who sank the love boat?
