- we're never told) desire to take a trip from south america (the film's locale) to the famed city in louisiana. why does the mute kid want to go there? your guess is as good as any. it's another one of those cute &quot;foreign&quot; kind of things typical of international films that are there for atmosphere and not much sense. there's no sense in your visiting this baton rouge anytime soon. my rating * out of ****. 5 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
