user reviews &nbsp; it&#39;s a kind of magic(less) sequel... 31 july 2006 | by frank markland (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews christopher lambert reprises his role as connor mccleod who this time goes up against an evil immortal kane(van peebles in a terrible performance) who is thawed out of suspended animation, of course once he defrosts, it&#39;s up to mccleod to put him (back) on ice. i admit that this is probably my favorite sequel, only because the beginning reminds me of kung fu sequel, with mako teaching lambert swordsmanship and kung fu, however that aside the movie is fairly uninspired but not too dull and really it makes logical sense, even in comparison with the original (the only sequel to do so.) the suspended animation thing is a lame way to bring up a new enemy but at least it doesn&#39;t explain that they are from a different planet, or completely contradict the original like the fourth. the fight sequences are decent and the production values while somewhat cheap play passably on screen, so overall it&#39;s a mediocre sequel. nothing special but at least semi-watchable.* * out of 4-(fair) 7 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
