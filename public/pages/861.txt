sinatra imitator very funny, as is the seemingly five minutes of silence they hold on the quaid/newton bit. also funny, the server in the buffet &quot;oh you're right, this is chicken want some!&quot; and chevy chase butt-ugly costume. 10 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
