nothing else on tv? 19 june 1999 | by mi$ guy (texas) &ndash; see all my reviews is nothing else on tv? are you really bored? well, then watch phat beach. however, don't rent it and definitely do not buy it. that would be a big mistake.i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points. i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard. however, there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at. if you are looking for an extremely funny &quot;hood&quot; movie then watch friday. if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie tries at..kind of) watch something like hoop dreams or jason's lyric. if you are lookin for some good black &quot;booty&quot; go watch a dominique simone porn flick, because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent. however, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it. you will be slightly amused. ***3 out of 10*** 1 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
