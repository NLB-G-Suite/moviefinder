see all my reviews the usual suspects is two movies in one. enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round. the first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `i could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer. it requires a certain amount of commitment, though. be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.it concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like keyser soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea. the plot is rather intricate so i shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that christopher mcquarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before. that's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.gabriel byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured dean keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer edie finneran (suzy amis) is badly explored and i never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie. kevin spacey is wonderful as the crippled roger 'verbal' kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic. the real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented pete postlethwaite as kobayashi, supposedly keyser soze's right-hand man. he effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.director bryan singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes i may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts. 108 of 130 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
