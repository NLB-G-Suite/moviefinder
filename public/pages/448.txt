trivia the helicopter used in aerial shots belonged to real life ex-army pilot jerry m. baxter. it was hired while he was running a crop-dusting business, after the filmmakers fancied a helicopter attack and spotted this one as perfect for the job. baxter was also not only hired to fly it, but was asked to play the part of the harbor patrol pilot as well. in addition, he also built the full scale model that was capsized by the shark using salvage parts, and sold it to universal at the film's completion. see more &raquo; goofs brody wears his badge on the right side of his chest, whereas all new york and massachusetts law enforcement officers wear their badges over the left. see more &raquo; quotes ellen brody: that's your third smoke already! martin brody: with coffee... ellen brody: try a donut. see more &raquo; connections referenced in dvd-r hell: the day the clown cried&nbsp;(2014) see more &raquo; soundtracks teach me tonight (uncredited) music by gene de paul see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: is it true that there are major differences between the movie and the novel?

one could only hope that on its own level it was a decent film. and that is exactly what we get. to try and view this film and compare it to the original is an impossible task. the original &quot;jaws&quot; is one of the great films of all time. viewers need to approach &quot;jaws 2&quot; with the first film completely out of mind. the sequel picks up a few years after the first film. the setting is the same (amity island) and roy scheider is back as chief brody. also returning are murray hamilton as the mayor, lorraine gary as mrs. brody, and jeffery kramer as deputy hendricks. gary and kramer have bigger parts this time around while hamilton still mills about not doing much of anything as he did in the original.the story this time centers around the teenagers of amity island headed by the older brody sons (who are amazingly quite older then just the few years passed), particularly older brother mike and his friends. they all like parasailing and you know what that means right? early on brody starts getting indications of another shark problem and takes his concerns to the town board and mayor. one of the biggest flaws in the film is their attitude, which is the same as the mayor's in the first film. wouldn't you think they might have a little concern considering what had happened a few years earlier? the movie moves at a snail's pace for the first hour but things pick up in the second half once the teenagers take the sailboats out and realize the trouble that awaits them.on the positive side the shark looks as good, if not better, then in the first film. it is completely convincing. scheider gives his usual solid performance despite playing second fiddle to a mechanical fish. and the second half of the film is quite suspenseful at times. there is one shot that has to be seen to be believed. an unconscience mike brody is in the water with the shark fast approaching. his friends are trying to lift him into the boat. the shark comes out of the water and.... well i won't tell you what happens but i think it is the best shark shot in the entire series of &quot;jaws&quot; films.on the negative side the characters of the teenagers are pretty one dimensional and we don't get to know many of them well enough to care if they end up as shark dinner or not. one of the teens played by donna wilkes spends the last half hour doing nothing but screaming. the screams are so annoying either you almost wish she would fall in the water and be done with it. a scene with a helicopter in the water is as ridiculous as things can get. the ending (not revealed here) is a touch silly but if you think about it the ending to the original was no more silly. in the end &quot;jaws 2&quot; is a decent but not great followup. for those that truly dislike the film i invite them to watch &quot;jaws 3&quot; or &quot;jaws: the revenge&quot;. those films make part 2 look like the classic the first one is. 16 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
