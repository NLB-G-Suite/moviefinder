edit did you know? trivia as in the previous star trek film (star trek: the wrath of khan (1982)), the movie includes the famous "space, the final frontier" monologue, spoken by spock. as in the previous film, the words have been changed slightly, referring to seeking out "new life forms" instead of just "new life". this was the final use of this modified version of the monologue until star trek (2009), where it is also spoken by spock. see more &raquo; goofs when kirk inquires to admiral morrow about possibly repairing and refitting the enterprise, morrow tells kirk that there is to be no refit because the enterprise is &quot;over 20 years old&quot; (as of 2285-the year this movie is set). this is an understatement if we consider information established from the star trek: the cage and the star trek &quot;menagerie&quot; 2-parter. those stories had established that kirk's 5-year mission with the enterprise (from 2266-2270) was not the first 5-year mission for that vessel, but in fact the enterprise had at least 2 previous 5-year missions under then-captain christopher pike from 2251-2262, which would make the enterprise at least 35 years old and not 20 as admiral morrow suggested. this also does not take into account the previous enterprise missions under captain robert april in the 2240s mentioned in star trek: the animated series the animated series, but this is often disregarded as the animated series is not considered to be part of star trek canon. however, it is irrelevant how old the enterprise is. it could be 35 years old, or 100 years old, the fact remains that all of these dates are technically &quot;over 20 years old.&quot; see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] [spock's dying words, repeated from the previous film] captain spock: don't grieve, admiral. it is logical. the needs of the many outweigh... kirk: ...the needs of the few. captain spock: or the one. i have been and always shall be your friend. live long and prosper. see more &raquo; crazy credits leonard nimoy is credited as director in the opening credits, but is not included in the cast list. there is a long gap between the names of william shatner and deforest kelley, which lasts for the length of time nimoy's name would have been displayed. see more &raquo;

user reviews the weakest of the &quot;trilogy.&quot; 26 january 2003 | by li-1 &ndash; see all my reviews 3.5 out of 10star trek iii, naturally entitled the search for spock, should have been an exhilarating adventure that lauded the bonds of friendship and honor, but instead, it comes off as a hokey, boring journey lacking in imagination and exciting conflict. even the movie's key scene, the destruction of the enterprise, is delivered in ho-hum fashion.it turns out spock is still alive, mind-melded into the doctor's body while his own physical state is currently regenerating on the planet genesis (why spock would do this without knowing his body would be regenerated is pretty harsh, considering the schizoid mental problems mccoy begins to suffer from). thus, kirk disobeys his superiors, hijacks the enterprise, and goes on a quest to mend spock's body and mind together. highlighting the movie's biggest flaw is the horribly unconvincing soundstage that represents genesis. most of the visual effects are quite good, but any scene set on that planet's surface throws all &quot;reality&quot; out the window. the film also moves at a painfully slow pace, never delivering much in the way of taut suspense, and the plot fails to conjure up any intriguing ideas or surprises. this trek was a necessary installment, and at least the follow-up, the voyage was superior, but this is one movie that's hard to plod through, and i'm a trek fan. 10 of 19 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
