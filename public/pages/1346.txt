funny!!! quote: i am here to spread joy, if i can find her?many many cameo appearances from celebrities and movie stars (from michal bolton to bert reynolds to porn king ron jeremy) adds to this enjoyable flick! definitely recommend for all rodney fans!!! 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
