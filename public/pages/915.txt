dr. david krane: the police band radios. curtis avery: no, that was a rhetorical question, david. that was one to which i didn't really expect an answer. dr. david krane: you know me curtis, i think most of them will look better in plastic-zipper suits. you got the smoke? curtis avery: no, i think it's something like fingerprints, we can just guess... yeah, i brought the smoke. see more &raquo; connections featured in the making of 'unforgettable'&nbsp;(1996) see more &raquo; soundtracks unforgettable written by irving gordon (uncredited) performed by nat 'king' cole (as nat king cole) courtesy of capitol records under license from cema special markets see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews reasonably enjoyable thriller that almost manages to shake off it's central terrible idea 24 august 2002 | by bob the moo (united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews dr david krane's world caves in when his wife is murdered and he is a major suspect. for legal reasons the case falls apart but the shadow hangs over him. when a colleague develops an experimental fluid that allows users to experience the memories of others krane starts to use it to try and piece together what happened to his wife. however with the drug impacting on his heart he only has so long to uncover the truth.some thrillers manage to have good ideas and spoil them with a bad film. some turn bad ideas into good films, but many are spoilt by a bad idea. this thriller works well for much of the investigation by krane &#150; but when it relies totally on the memory drug to move things along it really is very weak indeed. the direction is good enough to give the illusion of pace and excitement but really it never manages to shake off this central terrible idea and the film suffers as a result.liotta is always ok in most things but really hasn't much to work with. he does well despite the material. fiorentino was great in the last seduction but only because she had a great character in a great story. here she has no character in a dumb thriller and it shows. support from mcdonald, coyote, kim cattrall and kim coates vary between average and good but really they are mainly all red herrings to try and sustain the interest.overall this is enjoyable in most parts but where it relies on the memory drug heavily it falls down a bit. goes to show that you can't make a purse out of a pig's ear and this film never manages to shake off the fact that it's central idea is just plain dumb. 5 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
