see all my reviews star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits the resurgence in popularity of the plasticine two-some has caused me to also seek out this 1995 entry into the series, the last short film and the only other one i&#39;ve seen (i don&#39;t think i got round to a grand day out.) this time, dodderingly traditional yorkshire-man wallace and his faithful manservant gromit have come up with a spot of bother in the shape of a mysterious pest that&#39;s leaving holes in everything in the house, especially the cheese! wallace won&#39;t be having this and vows to investigate! but, first things first, him and gromit have to run their new window-cleaning service, and their latest customer is wendolene, who runs a wool shop left to her by her departed father. but, aside from providing a tricky love interest for wallace, she also has a brutish looking pet dog. and, after a series of local sheep are killed for their fur, the finger of suspicion points somewhere.technically, this is as fine as twt and it&#39;s very funny in parts, but the plot here just feels a bit disjointed and over-whelming compared to the smoother flow of the plot to twt. but it&#39;s still a far-cry from bad, as such impressive model craftsmanship would be, with park&#39;s twisted blur between the laws of man and animal as high as ever, as gromit is dealt with not by the rspca after being wrongfully convicted of sheep-murder, but the police and jail! **** 8 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
