user reviews &nbsp; pacino and de niro together... simply great ! 13 january 1999 | by peres-2 (haifa, israel) &ndash; see all my reviews most of the comments i've read here agree that this is a great movie. i have the same opinion. the coffee shop scene tells everything about this film: 10/10. the human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning de niro's character (neil). his personal conflicts are as strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. this is the magic of this film and only two fantastic actors like pacino and de niro could represent it so totally. congratulations to val kilmer that shined and performed exceptionally well under the huge shadow of pacino and de niro. a must see ! 168 of 222 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
