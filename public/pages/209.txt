trivia the first cut shown to the studio was under two hours in length and the story was confusing. philip kaufman was asked to add in scenes he cut. the next day they were shown the theatrically released version. it's believed kaufman showed them a shorter and confusing version in order to get his almost three-hour final cut approved with no questions of cutting it. see more &raquo; goofs after tomas the window-washer slugs back the wine offered to him by the communist party official's wife, the wineglass refills as he sits down on the chair next to the sideboard. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] first title card: in prague, in 1968, there lived a young doctor named tomas... tomas: take off your clothes.
