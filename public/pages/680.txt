frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews do you even watch the show?! 25 august 2001 | by colbys cowgirl (dallas, texas) &ndash; see all my reviews i have read a bunch of these other reviews, in which many people seem to strongly dislike the 1997 movie &quot;leave it to beaver.&quot; well, i have one question for them: do you even watch the show?! the 1997 movie combines countless themes and storylines from various episodes of the original series, a technique that is enjoyable and funny. the actors are great, and it is wonderful to see some of the original show's cast making cameos in the film (such as the actors who originally played june cleaver, eddie haskell, and lumpy). the movie gives a fresh twist to a classic television series, and effectively bridges the gap between generations. this film is enjoyable for younger children and teens who may not have seen the original series, as well as being exciting for parents or other adults who know and love the cleaver clan from way back in the 50s. this film is a true winner, despite pointless criticisms that it may have received. 5 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
