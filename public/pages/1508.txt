see all my reviews elmer bernstein's music for this outstanding motion picture is superb. the main character displays courage in the face of what life has given him (dwarfism and family despair). as for the girl he loves and adores in his early life, she too overcomes the horrors of a traumatic experience (seeing her father with another woman) during her early childhood. the supporting cast did just that (magnificent support to make the main characters believable). and for a change, even though there are so many sad moments in the life of frankie, the conclusion is a happy one for those who persevere. love doesn't conquer all, but it makes life beautiful. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
