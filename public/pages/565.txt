trivia actress madeleine stowe appeared in the film 'uncredited'. stowe's character of maria mcguire was a lead figure in the original stakeout (1987) movie but is only an intermittent bit part in this sequel. see more &raquo; goofs when chris is following bill who is being held captive in the trunk of a car. the mercedes sl that chris is driving is clearly shown to have its convertible top down in many scenes, however whenever a close-up is taken of chris driving, you can see his rear window which would indicate that the top is actually up. see more &raquo; quotes [chris lecce is angry with gina garrett because of her interference in the stakeout] chris lecce: if this assignment gets blown, i want to go on record right now, that this is the most stupid, dimwitted, idiotic, moronic piece of putrefied garbage that i have ever in my entire professional career, ever had the displeasure of being involved with. see more &raquo; connections referenced in spin city: internal affairs&nbsp;(1999) see more &raquo; soundtracks love has a mind of its own written by tom snow and jim scott (as jimmy scott) performed by ray charles courtesy of warner bros. records, inc. by arrangement with warner special products see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; such a fine enjoyable movie! 21 july 2007 | by boba_fett1138 (groningen, the netherlands) &ndash; see all my reviews don&#x27;t ask me why but when i was younger i would often watch this movie and the first one; &#x22;stakeout&#x22;. of those two movies this is the one that has always stayed most in my mind.basically this movie is just great entertainment. like all those type of movies from that period there isn&#x27;t much to the story and the movie is all about its characters and actors playing them. compare it to the &#x27;lethal weapon&#x27; movies, minus all of the action.this movie does have some fine characters and actors portraying them. even better is the chemistry they all have. richard dreyfuss form emilio estevez a great &#x27;buddy&#x27; cop duo and rosie o&#x27;donnell is also a fine addition to the two, basically since she is such a fine comedy actress. it also sort of makes you wonder why richard dreyfuss hasn&#x27;t appeared in more comedy roles. he obviously has the talent and certainly the right timing for it. guess he better wants to be remembered as a &#x27;serious&#x27; actor and who can really blame him for that. the movie further more features dennis farina, miguel ferrer and madeleine stowe.the movie is filled with some great comedy moments. that mostly, again, work out due to the characters and actors of the movie. the movie has some guaranteed laughs and make this a perfect typical &#x27;no worries&#x27; movie. just sit back and enjoy watching it!it also shows that john badham is actually a fine genre director! the timing is great and the pace, editing and positioning all make sure that the comedy in the movie works out even better.it&#x27;s too bad that the story just mostly distracts from the movie and its humor. it&#x27;s just not anything solid, interesting or something that hasn&#x27;t been done before. but then again, this is all quite typical for the genre and time period it was made in. basically if you enjoyed one or more of the &#x27;lethal weapons&#x27; movies, you&#x27;ll surely enjoy this movie as well.guess the movie could had impressed some more by putting in some more and bigger action. the movie now feels quite simple and cheaply made at times, which at times becomes distracting but overall doesn&#x27;t take away any of the fun of the movie.great entertainment!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ 9 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
