trivia despite the ending of the movie taking place in seattle, for some reason production filmed and used an established shot of philadelphia from the vantage point of the south street bridge. several key identifiable landmarks are visible in this shot and there is obviously nothing resembling a space needle to even vaguely pass it off as the intended location. why they did this has never been revealed. see more &raquo; goofs when mason fights wolfe sr, it&#39;s still pretty dark, but in the shot of burns driving away there&#39;s quite a bit of light. we see one shot of mason shouting - dark again - and then mason too gets on an atv - and suddenly there&#39;s a lot more light. see more &raquo; quotes jack mason: you're the doctor?
