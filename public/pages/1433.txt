frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; the cost of coal mining 20 july 2010 | by steve skafte (nova scotia, canada) &ndash; see all my reviews few films capture the strange and elusive energy of maritime canada, and those that try are often so inept as to do it no justice. the style of speech and emotional resonance of these characters carries through in a way that cannot be pretended at or treated like some amusing passing interest. &#x22;new waterford girl&#x22; got it right. so does this film. it takes a strong, central female performance to tie this story together, and it gets that in helena bonham carter. she is luminous in her look and speech, a kind of animal type of push for freedom. kate nelligan is fully convincing as her mother, a believable reflection of who she might become.the general look and feel of &#x22;margaret&#x27;s museum&#x22; is a curious thing. the style of director mort ransen and cinematographer vic sarin is very straightforward. the images are driven by content solely, by composition. every visual aspect is informed by straight realism. it&#x27;s not the sort of film that makes you say &#x22;what a beautiful shot,&#x22; but instead &#x22;what a beautiful person/place/thing.&#x22; you see past the camera, more to what is there in front of you, in front of the characters.the ending (which proves the reason behind the film&#x27;s title) is a bug surprise. every single day, ordinary people do strange and unexpected things, but it is rare to find a script that takes a real, human character and gives her one such bizarre action to commit. but &#x22;margaret&#x27;s museum&#x22; is a fascinating, unexpected film. it takes a well-used dramatic arc and directs it toward uncommon places. it captures the spirit and feel of cape breton, nova scotia. something i&#x27;ve known quite well, and could always feel more. see this. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
