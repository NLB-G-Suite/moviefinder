trivia jaimie alexander was considered for cameron phillips. see more &raquo; goofs terminator cameron phillips holds a gun with her index finger extended beside the trigger. this is a safety provision used by humans to prevent unintentional discharge of the weapon. however, being a machine, she is not susceptible to surprise or emotion that would result in an accidental shooting or &quot;trigger finger&quot; response. see more &raquo; quotes sarah connor: [season 1 opening intro] in the future my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet, a computer system programmed to destroy the world. it has sent machines back through time. some to kill him, one to protect him. today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created. to change our future. to change his fate. the war to save mankind begins now! see more &raquo; connections referenced in the big bang theory: the terminator decoupling&nbsp;(2009) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how did the terminator head travel through time?

i look at that news like this, fox are a group of complete idiots when it comes to tv anymore but...at least the show had a chance and lasted two seasons, most shows don&#x27;t even get that..... bravo fox for killing another show and angering millions of fans. 134 of 165 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
