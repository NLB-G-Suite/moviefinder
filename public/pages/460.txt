see all my reviews the idea of filming a play gets turned upside down as we see the players before and after the (rehearsal) performance, essentially as themselves. one remarkable scene shows the cast during intermission chatting with each other and audience members while munching on goodies from a caterer. it gives the experience of watching a play in an old, run-down theater, including comments from the director.the play itself is no less remarkable. shawn is a gifted actor, one of the few who can bring his entire body into a role. the rehearsal atmosphere takes some getting used to - it's hard to tell when real life ends and the play starts. there are no costumes, little in the way of sets, but it all works because the performances are so compelling. and chekhov's uncle vanya is surprisingly relevant 100 years after it was written. 9 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
