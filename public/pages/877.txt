user reviews &nbsp; another fantastic film that didn't get the recognition :-( 13 may 2005 | by mariek111 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i came across eve's bayou at the video store and decided to give it a shot. i am so glad i did. it is one of my favorite films. the story is outstanding and the acting has got to be some of best acting i have ever seen. its a shame that there aren't enough quality roles for black actors because there are some fantastic black actors and actresses out there. i like to think i can recognize talent when i see it and the performances in this film were nothing short of top notch. i immediately went out a bought this movie after i had rented it because it was just that good. the voodoo/cajun/french/bayou vibe was cool and i think thats what attracted me to it to begin with when i rented it. just wanted to share that with you folks and let you know that i would highly recommend this film. 21 of 26 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
