trivia the film finished shooting seven days behind schedule. the delays were caused by the complexity of shooting the rapid-fire dialogue, which had to be carefully timed with business and movement. the restaurant scene in which burns takes hildy and bruce to lunch took four days to shoot. the original schedule had only allotted two days for the scene. see more &raquo; goofs when walter goes to take hildy and bruce to lunch, his hat jumps from his right hand to his left hand between shots. see more &raquo; quotes walter burns: bruce, i, uh... let me get this straight. i must have misunderstood you. you mean you're taking the sleeper today and then getting married tomorrow?
