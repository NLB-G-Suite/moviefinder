charming and witty 29 may 2007 | by planktonrules (bradenton, florida) &ndash; see all my reviews i am not sure why this film isn&#39;t more famous, as it was a very entertaining romantic-comedy. considering that it was directed by vincente minelli and stars rex harrison, it can&#39;t help but be good. it&#39;s apparently good enough that the film was remade just a few years ago as what a girl wants.as the film begins, the cream of british society is readying itself for a long string of debutante balls--just as rex harrison&#39;s daughter from a previous marriage arrives from america (sandra dee). his new wife (played by his real-life wife, kay kendell) is having a disagreeable conversation with an annoying friend (angela lansbury) about these society dances when she feels compelled to announce that her step-daughter will be introduced to society at the next ball--even though the girl and her father have no interest in these stuffy affairs. but to please the step-mom, they go through with it. unfortunately, kay is pretty snobby and tries to arrange a marriage with an in-bred idiot and sandra. at the same time, kay is horrified that sandra is falling for a lowly drummer with a lousy reputation (john saxon). how all this is worked out to everyone&#39;s satisfaction is pretty funny and quite romantic. i think most of this is due to good writing and the nice gentle nature of the film. in fact, the longer i watched it, the more i liked it and found myself really being pulled into the story. it&#39;s a very good and often overlooked film--pity, as it really should be more widely seen. 10 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
