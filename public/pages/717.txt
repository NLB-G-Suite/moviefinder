trivia this film was adapted from a book by anne rice, and during the scene in new orleans people are arguing over whether a man is brad pitt or tom cruise. these two actors starred in a film adaptation of rice's interview with the vampire: the vampire chronicles (1994), which mostly takes place in new orleans. see more &raquo; goofs the morning after lisa spends the night with elliot, she is sitting on her balcony drinking tea. she puts down the tea cup, then a moment later it jumps back into her hand. see more &raquo; quotes fred lavery: read her her rights and make sure she understands them. sheila kingston: [mocking nina's accent] you have the right to remain silent. anything you say can and vill be used against you... see more &raquo; crazy credits hector elizondo's title credit is prefixed by 'as usual', referring to the number of times elizondo has appeared in films directed by garry marshall see more &raquo; connections references north by northwest&nbsp;(1959) see more &raquo; soundtracks why written by annie lennox performed by annie lennox courtesy of arista records, inc. see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; the book is in here somewhere 16 october 2001 | by tonesmyth (arizona) &ndash; see all my reviews i watched this movie, having been a fan of anne rice's novels. i found that a few of the scenes did a good job of imagining what the book was suggesting. these were mostly trivial in the movie. i really enjoyed the story and managed to sit through the horrible overlapping story (all of dan &amp; rosie's scenes) to catch a bit of the fantasy brought to the screen that had been in my head reading the book. i guess if it had been passed off as other than a comedy, it would have to be labeled pornography. the good parts of the movie show that this could have been a great project if they had attempted to stay close to the spirit of the novel. 6 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
