edit did you know? trivia during the shooting of the film, Éric rohmer was able to devise several working principles: improvisations with his cast that would be codified into a script; extensive rehearsals followed by very few takes (a miserly 1.5:1 shooting ratio was achieved); a discreetly spying, unostentatious mise-en-scène composed mostly of fluid long shots, capturing the vacationing characters awkwardly sharing the space of someone else's villa, whiling away the summer days and nights in a mixture of lassitude and tension. see more &raquo;

frequently asked questions q: what are the names of all six of rohmer's moral tales? see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; portrayals without heroes! 18 february 2016 | by hitchcoc (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i really appreciate the comments of other reviewer in helping me sort out the reasons i like rohmer&#x27;s &#x22;moral tales,&#x22; even though i cannot identify positively with the players. of course, that is what it is all about. when one cannot &#x22;pull for&#x22; someone, and must listen to the pretentious verbiage, it would be easy to dismiss such films. here we have several characters who are either incredibly cynical or hedonistic. haydee provides a true match for the two young men who seem to have an incredible amount of time on their hands. one could say that it&#x27;s remarkable that they seem moneyed when their personalities are so caustic. our narrator is a tall handsome man who once again has what he considers an unattainable &#x22;moral code.&#x22; haydee is sultry and cute and steals every scene she is in. she could easily be done in by the barbs tossed at her, but, ultimately, he is her own person and ultimately makes the decisions. most would have been intimidated by the two asses at the summer house. she rolls along. rohmer does some amazing close-ups to show the emotions in the faces of his characters. quite a masterful film. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
