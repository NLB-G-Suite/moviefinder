trivia director jack hill, when interviewed at the 1996 re-release of the film, pointed out that it did have some authenticity - he interviewed girl gang members and rewrote the script. "but the idea of doing a realistic movie about street gangs with beautiful blondes in hot pants was preposterous, so we tried to make it a wacky fantasy." see more &raquo; goofs lace cuts the necktie from the man in the elevator leaving about 6 inches of tie. when he identifies the ladies with the police moments later his tie is much longer. see more &raquo; quotes [after mom smackley tries to molest her] maggie: get your hands off me, you fat pig dyke! see more &raquo; connections referenced in gilmore girls: a house is not a home&nbsp;(2005) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; excellent drive-in trash 19 january 2004 | by preppy-3 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews film focuses on two gangs--the silver daggers lead by dominic (asher brauner) and the dagger debs lead by dominic's girlfriend, lace (robbie lee). a new girl in town maggie (joanne nail) joins the debs and becomes friends with lace--but dominic wants maggie. evil deb patch (monica gayle) knows this and manipulates lace into hating maggie. also there's a rival gang, the crabs, who are trying to take over.silly but very engaging trash movie--it's really an excellent movie of its type! there's prison fights, lesbian guards, rape, prostitution, feminism, politics, a black female gang and tons of violence and action. there's also a hilarious (and exciting) shoot out at a skating rink! there was a twist halfway through the movie that i didn't see coming and it all ends up with a climatic switchblade fight. i can honestly say i was never bored and enjoyed this thoroughly. the script is terrible but it never takes itself too seriously.as for the acting--brauner is ok as dom; nail is lousy as maggie and lee is terrible as lace--easily one of the worst acting jobs i've ever seen in a movie (and that's saying something). gayle was actually pretty good as patch. also of note is kitty bruce (lenny bruce's daughter) who's character (donut) is treated like dirt.the is not a good movie but an excellent trash film. next to &quot;coffy&quot; and &quot;foxy brown&quot; probably director/writer jack hill's best film... although he does call this a piece of trash. he's right! 8 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 47 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: lace maggie dominic crabs muff donut bunny hook guido cherry fingers mr. clutch principal weasel mom smackley ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
