user reviews &nbsp; an action-packed extravaganza!! 17 august 2006 | by lonewolfandcub (australia) &ndash; see all my reviews from dusk till dawn is simply a fun movie. not meant to be taken seriously at all. if you&#39;re looking for a movie to sit back and enjoy for brainless entertainment, get this. there is nothing wrong with the acting, the music really good and the special effects are gross (but great).the first half of the story revolves around the gecko brothers, seth (george clooney) and richie (quentin tarantino). they need to get past the mexican border to a bar named the &quot;titty twister.&quot; along the way they take hostage the fuller family, jacob (harvey keital), kate (juliette lewis) and scott (ernest liu). in the second part of the movie they make it to the bar, unfortunately it is a bar run by vampires and soon enough the feasting begins.this movie is great in a lot of ways. first, the script is written brilliant, it is darkly humorous. a lot of the lines had be laughing very hard. the acting is good from all the cast and the special effects are pretty disgusting. we have decapitations, limbs getting torn off, throats getting ripped out and plenty of impalements. for gore hounds, this movie is gold. this movie never really gets boring. this movie is not meant to be anything groundbreaking, just entertaining, which it is.3&frac12;/5. 27 of 37 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
