user reviews a well done family comedy 4 november 2000 | by misterwhiplash (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this type of family comedy truthfully works better if you are grown up with the stooges. because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take. i can though. but if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too i bet. the plot follows a kid (macaulay kulkin) who gets left behind in a chicago suburb while his family leaves for paris. and though the house is all his, 2 burglars (joe pesci and daniel stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house. but not without the climax. while most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing pesci getting his head on fire and stern screaming like a girl. funny, even if it's not john hughes' (writer/producer here) best. b+ 40 of 52 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
