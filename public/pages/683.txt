user reviews &nbsp; a perfect nighttime movie 10 june 2006 | by johegn (e-tuna, sweden) &ndash; see all my reviews i&#39;m not saying the acting was perfect, i&#39;m not trying to say the story was told in the most professional way or all by rules of film-making. it wasn&#39;t at all an up-tempo film hollywood style with lots of explosions and rapid smart dialogs.but, somehow, unlike most films with few exceptions, it had the capability of putting you in a certain mood. a mood of inconvenience, because you become one with the character john murdoch, mostly thanks to sewell&#39;s acting. maybe it&#39;s because when i&#39;ve seen this movie, it&#39;s always way past midnight, but i guess it&#39;s part of the ultimate experience from it.the thing is i&#39;ve only felt this way about a movie once before, and unfortunately, i can&#39;t remember the title of that movie, only that it ended with a picture of an ocean, and an alone man on the beach, leaving us never knowing if he would ever meet his girl again or not. i love when a picture put that enormous hill of emotions in your heart, and just as many questions in your head. that feeling, that mood.most of the actors has received bad reviews for this movie, not least on this forum. but in my opinion, rufus sewell is doing his part very well. first so uncertain, then slowly growing into his role. keither sutherland, in a pretty uncomfortable role as a scared, weak doctor does it surprisingly good. william hurt is hard and scarred, but soft on the inside. i guess the actors are telling more about their parts than the script itself. generally, all the actors seem to have captured this feeling, this sense, that colors all throughout the picture, making the picture. you are not watching it. you are in it. you are john murdoch.i&#39;d like to end with a quotejohn murdoch: &quot;when was the last time you remember doing something during the day?&quot;it sort of reveals the touch of it. if you haven&#39;t seen it, see it, in the middle of the night! if you&#39;ve seen it daytime, see it again at nighttime. not because you&#39;re tired, but because it&#39;s dark. 79 of 119 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
