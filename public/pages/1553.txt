see all my reviews this film was great when i first seen it, that was about 10 years ago. i cannot hardly remember this film but i can remember that cyborg (nemesis) i just call him or it &quot;arnie&quot;, and if it had a woman who was a body builder who played alex i think her role name was then this is the film i want to watch one last time! if anyone out their has this film could they please get in contact? i know i have a really slim chance of finding anyone who even commented on this but its a shot i'm willing to take! but this film was great when i watched it, i mean a cyborg that cannot be killed following and trying to kill alex it was great when i was little, but the scenes seemed enclosed and cramped, i've never seen the first but i have been told its better than this one if its true then maybe i was wrong and my little mind played tricks on me, anyways thanks ghostfacekillah20032004@hotmail.com 2 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
