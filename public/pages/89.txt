trivia robbie fox wrote the screenplay in 1987. in the original version, charlie was jewish and, according to robert n. fried, it was "initially conceived as being more about paranoia than commitment". mike myers wanted changes to the script that would allow him to do some serious acting and saturday night live (1975)-style comedy. see more &raquo; goofs the first customer in the butcher shop is shown being handed her purchased material, then leaving the shop. in the montage that follows this scene, she is again shown when charlie says &quot;mom, help! it was an accident in shop.&quot; see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] charlie mackenzie: excuse me, miss?
