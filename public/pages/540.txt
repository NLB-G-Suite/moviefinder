trivia john woo's earlier cut came in at the two hour mark, and featured more character development and more violence in the action scenes. see more &raquo; goofs the scene where the traitor pretends to be incapacitated by radiation from an &quot;exposed core&quot; of the weapons, and the ones listening seemingly believe that, is implausible. weapon grade plutonium has fairly little radioactivity, and that is alpha-radiation, which is easily stopped by plain clothes and the skin before it does any damage. furthermore, radiation poisoning does not kick in that fast. and last, suspending belief in these facts and assuming cracked weapons could kill, the teams would not go in without radiation meters to warn them off to prevent this exact scenario. so no one would be fooled by the fake radio transmission, especially if an investigation team was sent to find the bodies and discover that their causes of death were bullet wounds and not radiation poisoning. see more &raquo; quotes vic deakins: hale. pick up. pick up!
