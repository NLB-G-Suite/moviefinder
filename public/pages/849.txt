see all my reviews &quot;amityville dollhouse&quot; is your average low budget b-horror movie, but it isn&#39;t too bad in my opinion. it follows a suburban family who moves into a new house the father built, so it seems that there&#39;s no way the house could be haunted. but the amityville evil finds it&#39;s way in there, after they discover a dollhouse replicating the amityville house. they decide to give the dollhouse to their youngest daughter for her birthday, and that&#39;s where it all begins. the dollhouse begins to exert an evil force upon the family. i tend to have a soft spot for low budget, cheesy type horror films of this type. even though they may not be top notch quality, i find most of them entertaining, and they still manage to be alright in my book. most of the cast here are unknowns, i only recognized one actress: lisa robin kelly, who plays eric&#39;s sister, laurie forman, on that &#39;70s show (my favorite television show by the way). the whole dollhouse idea is kind of dumb, i don&#39;t know what a dollhouse really has to do with &quot;amityville&quot;, but in the context of the movie it seems to work. there aren&#39;t really any scary moments, and when it tries to be scary, it comes off more as campy, but i don&#39;t really take this film so seriously.granted it is a campy, low-budget horror flick, but &quot;amityville dollhouse&quot; still finds a way to entertain you, despite the cheap effects and minimal scares that it provides. some may think i&#39;m crazy, but i was entertained by this flick. it&#39;s nothing special and i wouldn&#39;t go too far out of your way to see it, but it&#39;s an okay corny horror movie. like i said, nothing special, but not too bad. 5/10. 3 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
