(he&#39;s also great in l&#39;infant). the dardennes are obviously influenced by robert bresson and have a similar interest in use of realistic sound, and observation of everyday tasks. they especially like workshops, and woodworking tools. like bresson, they eschew incidental music and produce a very naturalistic view of events. and they do it so well. this film will remain in your conscience for a long time after you have seen it, and should satisfy those who need a resolution and a conclusion in their movies, by offering at least an answer to one &quot;will he - won&#39;t he?&quot; dilemma.these guys are making some of the best cinema of the present era. 13 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 26 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: igor roger assita the garage boss riri nabil le postier geneviève amidou ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
