trivia although the movie was close to being universally panned by film critics, roger ebert and gene siskel were among the very few critics to give the movie a positive review. before his death, ebert stated that this was the review he had to defend more than any other he had written, and that it was the one most often cited as an example of him being a poor film critic. see more &raquo; goofs when alex tries to rescue drew from the ballast room flood, but they are caught and the water starts to engulf them, he says to her &quot;hold onto me.&quot; drew is deaf (which alex knows). see more &raquo; quotes alejandro: [half dressed] i took off mine... see more &raquo; crazy credits the 20th century fox logo fades into the ocean as the opening credits start to roll. see more &raquo; connections referenced in entourage: pie&nbsp;(2008) see more &raquo; soundtracks my dream written by shaggy (as o. burrell), robert livingston (as r. livingston), dennis halliburton (as d. halliburton) performed by shaggy produced by robert livingston and shaun pizzonia (as shaun 'sting' pizzonia) for big yard music group ltd. courtesy of virgin records america, inc. / virgin records ltd. see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: will there be a speed 3 movie sequel ? see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; everyone to the lifeboats! women, children and paying moviegoers first. 19 june 2002 | by chris brown (christopher6453@hotmail.com) (fresno, ca usa) &ndash; see all my reviews let the screenwriters and director go down with the ship i say. as the sun sets slowly in the west, speed 2: cruise control sinks without a trace. the sequel to 1995's surprise drive-a-bus hit has barely caused a ripple at the box office. the threadbare script is mostly to blame. it consists almost entirely of simplistic, exclamation-point dialogue like, &quot;we're gonna crash!&quot; &quot;we're going too fast!&quot; &quot;do something!&quot; &quot;this isn't happening!&quot; &quot;we gotta get him outta here!&quot; &quot;there's not much time left!&quot; and the ever useful, &quot;oh, s**t!&quot;there is, indeed, not much time left for characterization or interpersonal drama. speed 2 gets off to a winky-dinky start with sandra bullock taking yet another disastrous driving test. bullock's natural charm can go only so far, however, and you keep wanting to throw her a life preserver or a new script. as people drop dead around her, she must continue to whine about the ruination of her vacation. bullock doesn't get a lot of help from blandish co-star jason patric, who plays her cop boyfriend. the nasty, computer-literate villain, who likes to attach blood-sucking leeches to his body, is certainly quirky. willem dafoe, who's pretty quirky himself, does what he can with the overriding vagaries of his character's mad-bomber motivation. the action bits are fairly frequent, but seem anemic when compared to what else is available to fans of such. director jan de bont fared much better in 1996 with the flying cows and funnel clouds of twister. speed 2 ends up with some highly anticipated destruction as the cruise ship plows into the island of st. martin. no matter, as i hear the whole thing was computer-generated anyway. this cruise is no carnival, and could have used a cameo by kathie lee. would loved to have seen dafoe slap her around a bit. 40 of 53 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
