user reviews a distinctive &amp; memorable version of the 'dracula' legend 1 september 2004 | by snow leopard (ohio) &ndash; see all my reviews f.w. murnau's version of the 'dracula' legend still remains as distinctive and memorable as ever. the enjoyable bela lugosi version is perhaps easier to watch, and strictly as light entertainment it might work better, and many later versions brought their own interpretations - but nothing matches &quot;nosferatu&quot; for its engrossingly morbid atmosphere and its unusual interpretation of the main character.max schreck and murnau were able to create an image of the vampire that remains in your mind long after seeing it. regardless of whether it or some other conception is closest to the 'true' dracula (if such a thing even exists), it is quite effective, and it was particularly well-conceived for a silent screen version that cannot rely on dialogue to define a character. the settings and the story perfectly complement schreck's weird character, creating an atmosphere full of constant strangeness, uncertainty, and foreboding.it's unnecessary (and probably impossible) to make detailed comparisons among all the film versions of the dracula character and legend. &quot;nosferatu&quot; stands perfectly well on its own, as a unique and skillfully done adaptation of the story, and as one of the memorable classics of the silent era. 50 of 56 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 365 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
