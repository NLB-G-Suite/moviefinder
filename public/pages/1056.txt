trivia director tom dicillo didn't want to beg people for money to make this film, so he asked his actors if they would work for free. all of them agreed and most of them even put up money themselves. eventually anybody who contributed a few dollars got a part in the movie. see more &raquo; goofs the first few times the ac slates, what is written on the slate does not reflect what he calls off. see more &raquo; quotes nick: hey bob, you think you can make any more noise with the dolly you creaky motherfucker ! see more &raquo; crazy credits statement after the end credits: the characters and incidents portrayed and the names herein are sort of fictitious, and any similarity to the name, character or history of any person is sort of coincidental and unintentional. see more &raquo; connections referenced in the day the women took over or i was a teenage neo-impressionist&nbsp;(1998) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; film maker's delight 22 august 2004 | by mootosk (sydney) &ndash; see all my reviews this film captures the true essence of the stresses involved on a film set. the story is about the characters involved in the process rather than the film-within-a-film. while the film is funny it is so close to the bone that i was initially surprised to see it appear in the comedy section.steve buscemi is right at home in this film, his influence rubs off on the support actors, and his stress is convincing. this film makes you squirm but laugh - unlike conventional comedies - in this film you identify and live with the actors.the screenplay timing is superb and taunts the audience to an almost stressful level. offset this with lots of comedy and you're left with a powerful mix. you are almost relieved when it is over... but you are left with great memories of a strange but enjoyable film.absolutely the highest possible recommendation, especially if you can relate to film making, acting or directing. 18 of 23 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
