edit storyline dean is a maverick american film director surprised that his most recent film has been chosen as the official u.s. entry at the venice film festival. a beautiful french journalist arrives at the festival with the apparent intention of interviewing the unique and eccentric filmmaker. in the midst of all the festival madness, she is forced to confront the wide divergence between things as they really are and things as they seem to be - both on screen and off. and so, finally, are we. shot half in venice, italy and half in venice, california, "venice/venice" looks at the profound effect movies have had - and continue to have - on our lives, our loves and on our dreams of romance. written by henry jaglom plot summary | add synopsis plot keywords: film director | journalist | film festival | place name in title | repetition in title |&nbsp;see all (8)&nbsp;&raquo;

see all my reviews i certainly wish i had seen this movie ten years ago. &quot;venice/venice&quot; raises interesting questions about movies and television versus real life. a reporter falls in love with a director but struggles to separate her admiration of his work from the real person. although i saw this movie because duchovny was in it, his performance was not the highlight, although he had a couple of cute scenes in the second half of the film. one of the highlights are the clips shown throughout the movie of women commenting on their fantasies of characters played by cary grant and gary cooper. if it were filmed today, i bet some women would mention duchovny as their romantic on-screen hero.this movie was fascinating, if you have a chance to see it, do so. 2 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
