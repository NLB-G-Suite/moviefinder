very entertaining 3 january 2000 | by mike garber (stickman@u2.org) (waynesboro, virginia) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie has got to be one of the best i've seen. i've seen a lot of movies and a lot of musicals and &quot;everyone says i love you&quot; should go down as a great musical with &quot;singin' in the rain&quot; and as a great movie. i thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining, amusing, fun jaunt through musical bliss and the heartache of romance. i recommend this film to everyone! 22 of 40 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
