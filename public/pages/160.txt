trivia star barbara stanwyck was on call to replace katharine hepburn in the event hepburn was unable to appear in the film due to the surgery she had underwent just prior to production. stanwyck had star teamed with henry fonda in pictures in three earlier movies: the lady eve (1941), you belong to me (1941) and the mad miss manton (1938). the most recent of these, which were two of the films from 1941, having being made and released about forty years prior to on golden pond (1981). see more &raquo; goofs when norman lets billy ray go off in the boat by himself, we see him speeding across the lake. billy ray and the steering wheel are on the alternate sides of the boat in subsequent shots. see more &raquo; quotes billy ray: [after his father and chelsea left] i might not stick around here. i might just haul my ass up to wyoming, puerto rico, one of those places. listen, i know i'm just being dumped here. just like my middle name. you turkeys don't want me. norman: [quietly, yet emphatically] bullshit. i'm sixty-seven years older than you. how do you know what i want?
