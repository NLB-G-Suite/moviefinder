goofs when freddy heads into nyc to meet with tilden and ia, he walks under a path train sign as he walks up a stairway and then is right in the heart of city hall and one police plaza, so the premise is that he took the path train from hoboken to city hall/one police plaza area - that isn't possible. the path train would let him off a few blocks away at the world trade center area. in reality, stallone was walking out of a subway station in city hall with a fake path sign added by the director. see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; better than the other ones... 7 january 2005 | by guardia (brisbane, australia.) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie was always going to be interesting because it involves so many sides to the one story. there is an excellent balance established between all the factions involved in the case of a missing/dead police officer.the characters for this sort of movie are very original, and their flaws are revealed just as much, if not more so than their strengths. this has to be sylvester stallone's career highlight, and goes to show that his talents are not necessarily best for action movies. and de niro's understated but excellently played &quot;moe tilden&quot; leaves you wishing he was featured more. the scenes between these two characters are worth the viewing alone. harvey keitel as well, plays an excellent cop/quasi-crime boss.it's a little soppy at times but overall a stand-out in it's genre. 36 of 44 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
