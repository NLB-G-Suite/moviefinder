i was entertained 26 february 2005 | by theo robertson (isle of bute , scotland) &ndash; see all my reviews i notice a lot of people have very few kind words to say about space jam . i must admit that being a scot i have little interest in basketball and know very little of the career of michael jordan ( who's michael jordan ? ) but i still found this movie to be fair entertainment . i guess a lot of people dislike this movie because mr jordan played for such and such a basketball team a bunch of evil aliens invade looney tunes world and cast the cartoon characters into slavery and it's left to a sports legend to save them ! come on guys , plots don't come anymore original than that so what's there to dislike ? we also have a subplot of the aliens interfering with other basketball players which did cause some amusement to this audience member . also very enjoyable were the number of cameos that crept up through the movie , most notably bill murray okay i wouldn't say space jam is as great as who framed roger rabbit but it's still an entertaining family movie regardless of how you feel about sport . with this in mind i'm totally puzzled why my local itv station decided to broadcast it at 1.10 am ! 33 of 53 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
