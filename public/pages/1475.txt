trivia the scene where bobby (saul rubinek) decks a seller, for interrupting his concentration on searching the coins with carl (gailard sartain), was improvised and accidental. saul rubinek really got ticked at the bystander for interrupting their scene so he actually slugged him. then realizing what he did, he took off with gailard. director howard deutch thought the shot they filmed was too hilarious and decided to keep it in the film. see more &raquo; goofs the list of coins shown in the printout during the opening credits are relatively common coins and as described with major flaws, would be a collection worth only a few thousand dollars-a far cry from the $1.5 million used in the storyline. the $20 gold piece shown in closeup during the credits is far from an un-circulted example, so it is a coin worth little more than the price of an ounce of gold. also, if they removed the coins from their new pcgs holders and sold them &quot;raw&quot;, whatever their value, they would be worth substantially less than as &quot;certified&quot; in the their holders. see more &raquo; quotes [about timmy] bobby: man, that kid gets me so mad! carl: yeah, but i think he has a good influence on me. since he's moved in, the food's gotten much better. see more &raquo; connections referenced in the nostalgia critic: the pagemaster&nbsp;(2009) see more &raquo; soundtracks do you love me?

ooooooohhhh-la-la&#39;. so rent it, watch it, laugh, and if you love it, own it. xd 3 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 18 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: timmy ray theresa bobby carl alex lt. romayko mr. wankmueller kitty wayne zinn chapman guard guard armored car driver ----------- more... create &raquo; ?
