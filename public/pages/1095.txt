maybe people just don't appreciate the humour and subtle jokes. like the buffalo being a water buffalo! think about it, it is very funny in context. this movie is a must-see cult classic. so maybe not malcolm macdowell's best(that is clockwork orange). enjoy! 22 of 32 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
