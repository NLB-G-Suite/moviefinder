user reviews overall well done 12 december 2009 | by wizard-8 (victoria, bc) &ndash; see all my reviews i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. i had put off watching it for a long time because i thought it would fall on standard clich&#xe9;s in the telling of its murder mystery. but there&#x27;s a lot to like here. for starters, the performances by the lead actors are first rate. streep and neeson come across as real people tackling a real problem. i should also add that alfred molina also gives a solid performance as the defense attorney. (though the fact he looks like idiot movie critic michael medved gave me a few chuckles at times.) the script gives most of its characters a fair shake. the parents are sympathetic at times, but sometimes they make decisions we disapprove of. the townspeople and police are not one-note characters, showing off more than one side.the movie unfolds at a pace that keeps us interested and informed. it&#x27;s directed with an appropriate bleak look that suits the subject matter.there is one flaw with the movie, however. i thought that edward furlong&#x27;s character was repulsive, stupid, and hateful. i don&#x27;t blame furlong for this, but his direction and his parts of the screenplay. i think a better way the movie could have gone would be to give him a mixed view, neither overly sympathetic or hateful. this would make the viewer think long and hard about him, and wonder if his fate at the end of the movie is correct or not. 8 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 48 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: t.j ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
