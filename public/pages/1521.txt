frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews i must admit that i liked this film, sort of... 10 july 2001 | by nz man (new zealand) &ndash; see all my reviews if i had looked up this film here on imdb prior to searching for a video, i would not have picked this one. anyway, our video stores here offer cheap deals on tuesdays so i quickly chose hostile intentions, one of 4 videos for only a nz dollar each. i will have to admit that i only had the energy that evening to watch something simple, and to be honest, the sexy woman on the front cover were appealing. actually i was also intrigued about tia carrere, who is in some tv action series these days.the worst part of the film for me is that it does the usual hollywood exaggeration of events and stereotypes, which stretches the imagination. then again, there are some over-the-top people in this area of the world! but i have seen much worse films. the acting, script and action are quite good (put in context), and there is plenty of eye candy for the guys.i think the main reason that i liked this film was that i did not expect any more than a sexy action flick. usually my tastes are far higher, towards the intelligent art house films. if you can see this for free or on the cheap, and don't expect much, then go ahead and see it. 5 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
