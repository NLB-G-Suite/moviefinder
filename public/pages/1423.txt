trivia humphrey bogart was involved in a serious automobile accident during production of this film, which knocked out several of his teeth and hindered his ability to speak. john huston reportedly hired a young british actor noted for his mimicry skills to rerecord some of bogart's spoken lines during post-production looping. although it is undetectable when viewing the film today, it is peter sellers who provides bogart's voice during some of the scenes in this movie. however this cannot be confirmed. see more &raquo; goofs when the boat arrives at shore and the group come out of the sea, billy walks after peterson and stops just behind him. in the next shot, shown from the front, billy appears on the left side of peterson. see more &raquo; quotes o'hara: i give you my word, i feel to you like an older brother. oh, it's not so much a difference of age. it's probably, yes, the reason is, because i come from a culture which is so much older than yours. in my country, a child of 6 years old is older in his heart than you'll be at, at 60. billy dannreuther: it smokes, it drinks, it philosophizes... at this rate i'll be 60 before you get to the point. see more &raquo; connections featured in humphrey bogart: behind the legend&nbsp;(1994) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; the sub-par quality of this film detracts nothing from a great story 9 january 2006 | by davepyne (santa paula, ca) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie is the funniest thing i have ever seen. its very talky, and the plot is thick with double crosses, etc from the four crooks, and of course bogart himself. marco tulli as one of the low-life criminals has a face worth a thousand words. just seeing him with peter lorre, robert morley and ivor barnard is too much. they all look so incredibly guilty together. the extremely proper englishman played by edward underdown is a pleasure to watch as he reluctantly interacts with bogart and co. turning up his nose at their nefarious activities. the plot itself is well thought out and at the same time absurd so you'll never know what to expect, but when it happens you may chuckle and rub your hands together thinking &quot;that's perfect!&quot; its that kind of movie. this is a comedy for all us bogart buffs and fans of film noir who enjoy a break from drama to laugh at our beloved genre. people have complained about the picture quality, which i admit is not what it could be considering it was filmed in 1953. however, its not as bad as all that. it's only that the film has deteriorated a bit. the original camera work and audio work shines through the years of neglect this filmed has had to live through. all in all a hugely under-rated film, which i strongly recommend 36 of 49 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
