(andy garcia) the task of prosecuting. things proceed so smoothly in the first hour for our young hero that you just know that embarrassing revelations are going to come crashing down around him in the second hour, which they do.this is familiar turf for veteran filmaker sidney lumet, and he has made a fairly compelling film, despite the miscasting of british holm and cuban garcia as father and son, respectively, although holm does manage an amazingly authentic queens accent. leibman overacts outrageously as the head d.a.; one wonders how anyone as abrasive as he is would be able to get so far!some sequences are a little too pat for comfort. still &quot;manhattan&quot; makes for engrossing if predictable drama, exploring once again the extent to which the cumbersome wheels of justice have to be manipulated. richard dreyfuss is pretty good in a surprisingly small role as the drug dealers's dershowitz-like defense attorney, who turns out to be more willing to bend the rules than you would expect, considering his primary motive for taking the case. 7 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 30 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: jordan washington mcgovern instructor detective judge man in asylum legal aid attorney ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
