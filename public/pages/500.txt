(michael j. pollard). they begin doing more and more robberies until clyde is finally forced to kill someone. later on in their trip, clyde's brother (gene hackman) and his wife blanche (estelle parsons) catch up with clyde, c.w., and bonnie and they continue committing crimes such as robberies and even sometimes murders but usually in cases of self-defense. &quot;bonnie and clyde&quot; is beautifully acted and expertly directed. after &quot;bonnie and clyde&quot;, arthur penn directed some other good movies such as &quot;little big man&quot; but as good as they were all, none ever equalled &quot;bonnie and clyde&quot;. if you haven't seen it yet, you should put it first on your &quot;next movies to watch&quot; list. 44 of 73 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 366 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
