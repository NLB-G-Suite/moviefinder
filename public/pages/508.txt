an elderly man named homer looking for eternal peace; and the troupe of a financially failing circus, which has closed early for the season because of those financial problems. one day, damiel tells cassiel that he wants to become human, to feel not only the sensory aspects of physical beings, but also emotional aspects. he embarks on this thought with the full realization that there is no turning back if he decides to do so. his thoughts are largely ... written by huggo plot summary | plot synopsis plot keywords: suicide | library | angel | circus | berlin |&nbsp;see all (62)&nbsp;&raquo;

user reviews lyrical and haunting work of art 13 june 2004 | by brianh-9 (mississippi,united states) &ndash; see all my reviews two angels named damiel and cassiel are onlookers on the lives of people in berlin. damiel longs to become human mainly because of a trapeze artist he has become drawn to. both dote on how the world would look if they could see it with color, feel of things, and breathe air. the angels in wim wender's &quot;wings of desire&quot; are separated by the rest of the world and see this world in black and white. they look upon the many sad happenings that occur, how people go about their daily lives. the angels take notes and share lifelong memories of people they have looked upon over the years. they can hear people's thoughts and how they feel about their lives. damiel is the one the movie focuses on more. cassiel understands damiel's desire, but doesn't long for humanity iname way. the film isn't coy about the fact that being an angel could be quite lonely and sort of exasperating. the film's dialogue(mostly thought)from the people across berlin are more lyrical. it's as if their thoughts are a daily constant of shakespeare..a long tragedy of loneliness among other emotional longings. the trapeze artist, marion, is quite a thinker and always feels as if someone has always been their to guide her through the paths of life. peter falk(yep, columbo)appears as himself playing in a film in berlin. many address him as that famous detective. he, like the children, can sense the angels' presense around him..and there's quite an interesting reason why he can. the film is very pondering and haunting. life is quite bleak. berlin is a fascinating setting for a film like this. we often see what history has done to berlin..the scars show such devastation, yet this brings an element that reaches out to you. we see that life goes on around the ruin..the devastation. the angels have seen that ruin first hand. the film has cassiel following an old dying jew. there's a particular scene i love which has the old man walking down ruined streets. he says to himself,&quot;this can't be potsdamer platz.&quot; he continues to walk and remember the places that use to exist where only ruin reveals. this scene, among so many, define the film's elegant melancholy. the film really is an unforgettable gem. towards the end, our angel damiel makes a decision to accept a life as a human. this adds to the film's overall dilemma. i asked myself,&quot;are we taking things like smelling coffee, touching an apple, or simply watching the rain as it slides from a gutter for granted.&quot; the opportunities to exist and live should be appreciated somewhat. what if we are on the otherside of the spectrum? what if we had to look at others living and breathing and smelling? *****/***** 65 of 72 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
