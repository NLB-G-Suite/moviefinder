trivia many scenes in the trailer did not make the final cut because they re-shot the movie almost two years after it was first finished. the original version had, among other changes, a climatic fight between the two ladies with one dying. it was re-shot following bad feedback from test audiences. see more &raquo; goofs at the end of the film, jackson slaps his mother martha to the floor of the kitchen. martha falls in the middle of the floor. in the next shot, she is over by the stove with one arm over the door handle. a moment later she is back in the middle of the room. see more &raquo; quotes jackson baring: you do make a better impression with your clothes off. see more &raquo; connections references what ever happened to baby jane?&nbsp;(1962) see more &raquo; soundtracks as i walked out one evening written by w.h. auden (1938) used by permission of curtis brown ltd. see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews could have been a hot b-movie!! 17 january 2005 | by rossini1868 (north carolina) &ndash; see all my reviews everybody should just relax and enjoy watching a red hot, middle aged momma's sexual jealousy over her beautiful daughter in law. the photography was great, loved the rural location (without the stupid horses), and gwyneth and jessica look as good as they ever have. the problem is that the director tried too hard for believability, and that resulted in a very average, plodding, sometimes laughably bad movie. if they had taken it over the top, like what you find in good novels, (torture, perversion), then we would have had a classic. its a shame they held back because jessica and gwyneth looked amazing. who cares if their performances weren't great? their screen presence made up for it. they were ripe for a deliciously violent, twisted older woman/younger woman b-movie and the director blew it. (check out piper laurie and sissy spacek in &quot;carrie.&quot; they set the standard for over the top, twisted mother-daughter action.) 13 of 21 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 69 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: lisa sister o'shaughnessy gavin dr. franklin hill hal bentall clayton richards georgina richards priest church warden usher doctor ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
