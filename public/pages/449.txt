trivia the movie was directed by joe alves who had been the production designer on jaws (1975) and jaws 2 (1978) and was also the second unit director for on the latter. trade paper 'variety' said "joe alves was instrumental in the design of the first jaws shark and was the unsung production hero in both the first two pictures". see more &raquo; goofs the front of a submersible seems to vanish briefly as it rotates. the sub model clearly reflected the color of the special effects background (a greenscreen or something similar) and got &quot;keyed out&quot; when the underwater footage was added. see more &raquo; quotes kathryn morgan: he needs eyes in the back of his head, calvin. see more &raquo; crazy credits in the original 3d version, the universal pictures logo is in 3d. plus the title "jaws 3d" comes "toward" the viewer, clamping together as if it was like a shark's mouth. see more &raquo; connections referenced in i hate everything, the search for the worst: shark exorcist&nbsp;(2016) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how much sex, violence, and profanity are in this movie?
