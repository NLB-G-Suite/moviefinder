trivia in reality, prefontaine originally tried out for both basketball and football, but had failed to make both teams, due to his short height when he was in junior high school. he eventually decided to try out for cross country after he saw some school members jog to his school's football field. once he made the team, he literally fell in love with running track at school. see more &raquo; goofs a 1990s-era jeep cherokee is visible in the background at a track meet. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] bill bowerman: pre turned distance running into a blood sport. you wanna know what he meant to folks around here?
