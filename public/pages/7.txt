they lived their whole lives in a cruel and sunless world. in those days pigs believed that the sooner they grew large and fat, the sooner they'd be taken into pig paradise, a place so wonderful that no pig had ever thought to come back. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews this is one of the sweetest movies i have ever seen. not preachy, but yet extends a message of love and harmony.just loved the pig, and james cromwell was terrific as the somewhat befuddled but good-hearted farmer. the climax is a wonderfully quiet and touching scene. it's a movie about friendship and trust, you should see it, no matter how old you are. 33 of 40 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
