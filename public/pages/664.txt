trivia kasi lemmons plays the best friend here, bernadette. she played the best friend in another slasher movie before this, the silence of the lambs (1991). see more &raquo; goofs in order for 'helen' to appear, someone has to say her name five times. at the end of the film, trevor is heard saying it five times. viewers may incorrectly thought he said it only four times, since the time gaps between his saying 'helen' was quite large due to the interference of his crying scenes and stacey's kitchen scenes. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] candyman: [candyman narrating over the swarm of bees] they will say that i have shed innocent blood. what's blood for if not for shedding?

3 september 1999 | by tht (new york, ny) &ndash; see all my reviews candyman is one of my all time favorite horror movies. it is genuinely scary, and it makes one have second thoughts when standing in front of a mirror.what i particularly enjoyed about the movie is the multidimensional development of the plot at the sociological, psychological, and parapsychological level. the first scene of the movie presents in a nutshell the experience that the viewer is going to have, an experience so common (regarding urban legends) yet so distant.the acting (esp. by virginia madsen) is superb. the setting could not be more perfect. the shaggy, derelict apartment buildings at cabrini green create the proper ambience for what is to follow.certainly the gory scenes are not very attractive, and in a way such explicit portrayal does not seem necessary, since the psychological suspense is the driving force of the movie. also the ending is rather anticlimactic and overdrawn. disappointing sequel....fun to watch with people who scare easily! 26 of 36 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
