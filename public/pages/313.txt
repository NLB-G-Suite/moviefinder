(queens council) presented the case. pierce never represented or met giuseppe conlon, who died in 1980, nine years before the appeal. see more &raquo; goofs in in belfast apartment, as mr. conlon is prepares to go to london to help gerry, he throws some cds in his case. see more &raquo; quotes gareth peirce: it's not the stairs that are killing your father. gerry conlon: aye, what is it then? gareth peirce: it's your lack of faith. gerry conlon: lack of faith? faith in what? gareth peirce: in yourself. gerry conlon: no. i have faith in myself. gerry conlon. lifer. 30-year sentence. and i know how to survive it, no problem. gareth peirce: at what price? gerry conlon: i'll pay the fuckin' price, don't you worry about it. gareth peirce: the price for what? gerry conlon: aye. you're very good at the english, aren't you? you see, i don't understand your language.
