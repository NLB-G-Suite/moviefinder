trivia the opening "wet strip", in which barb dances in a strip club with her breasts hanging out of her rubber dress, while being sprayed with water, was suggested by pamela anderson after she was inspired by a nightmare she had, in which she was being sprayed with champagne while performing a "nasty dance". david hogan, who was under pressure to include more nudity, liked the idea, and threw out the movie's original opening to include it. see more &raquo; goofs after retrieving the memory of one of schmitz&#39;s men, as the directorate colonel is talking about capturing cora d, he picks up a metal tool which is covered in blood on the end. but then as he holds it the end of the tool is completely free of any blood. when he places it back on the tray, blood is still on it once again. see more &raquo; quotes woman in torture room: [moans] colonel pryzer: why don't we start again?
