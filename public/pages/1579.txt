the cure for writers' block... 14 july 2000 | by brian (bcuojoe@gateway.net) (sacramento,ca.) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;paris,france&quot; is a great film...daring,shocking and crafted with great wit, i was enthralled by the story and it's methods of provoking gasps of surprised laughter...it is a comedy, hard to believe with it's ill designed poster. unfortunately, the distributers just saw the rating and heard about the sex and...well, they designed the box for the blockbuster erotic thriller set in mind. this film will most likely never reach the audience it deserves. it's a movie about creative people who are easily obsessed with ideas,memories and the passion they put forth through their own art. the main charactor is a poetess, whose own obssession is the memory of paris, and the lover she had there. the prospect of a new lover opens up doors for her, and she soon finds herself trying to relive her experiences with a fellow writer who can barely keep up.the poetess, as played by leslie hope is timid one moment, then surprisingly dominant and forceful the next. these changes happen so frequently we begin to worry about her sanity. fortunately, these sudden moodswings often ignite powerful setpieces laced with very wise and biting humor.a low budget film that questions morality, our views on sex and how insane it all can seem. low budget but filmed very well, and packed with riviting performances by all the leads. i was suprised to find that the director mainly works in television. hopefully, his next film project will be handled and distributed with more care than this one.highly recomended!!!10 out of 10 17 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
