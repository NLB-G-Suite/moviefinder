how can you people rate this marvelous masterpiece a 3.8 when the effing oogieloves got a 7.3? this belongs in the top 250! it belongs with the godfather and the shawshank redemption in the top ten of the top 250! you 204 people who gave gordy a 1/10 rating need new lives! i bet it&#x27;s the same people who love sanjay and craig, marvin marvin, and breadwinners! or even the same people who hate liv and maddie! have you noticed that? this movie is a lot like liv and maddie with it&#x27;s great focus on family and friendship being more important than fame and fortune! and that very focus on family and friendship also makes it a lot like lady and the tramp! we need more movies like this! we really do! the closest thing we got to this in a long time was last year when we got frozen! you know this movie is great when at least two people i know like it even better than frozen! it&#x27;s true. grandma and dad both thought that! and it&#x27;s actually three because i have a friend named aston who liked it more than frozen and babe! rating this lower than breadwinners is no better than the lion king being rating lower than toddlers and tiaras. this movie is wonderful and whoever says otherwise is an absolute idiot! 6 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
