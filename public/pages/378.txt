trivia according to terence stamp, he had gotten into character by imagining himself as a beautiful woman. but stephan elliott told brian j. breheny to make stamp look as bad as possible. stamp never watches his dailies so he had no idea how he looked until the premiere and was shocked. breheny apologized to stamp at the premiere. see more &raquo; goofs after the bus breaks down for the first time in the australian outback, and tick (hugo weaving) has just given up on trying to fix it, he sits down to eat breakfast with bernadette (terence stamp). in the exchange, a cameraman and some crew members are visible in the reflection of bernadette's sunglasses. see more &raquo; quotes bernadette: [to the bartender] hello. could i please have a stoli and tonic, a bloody mary and a lime daiquiri, please?

see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; toward the acceptance of diversity 15 january 2005 | by jpizzo9 (bronx, new york) &ndash; see all my reviews this is a film that every straight person should see. the screenwriter created three drags queens from the cloth of everyday life &#151; an older person (who happens to be transgendered), an average guy next door and a pretty muscle boy. you can say that this film is about &quot;the great reach of little lives&quot; (a comment originally applied by donald spoto to tennesee williams' &quot;the glass menagerie.&quot;) we also see, in anthony bellerose's story, that sexuality is not a cut-and-dried affair. underneath it all, we see that these people aren't much different from those we meet ion our daily lives. a screening of &quot;priscilla&quot; would do more good than a hundred lectures to high school kids on the acceptance of diversity. 44 of 62 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
