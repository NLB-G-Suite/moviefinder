see all my reviews i don&#x27;t care for dystopic gay movies nor violence nor s&#x26;m so am sort of in a bind on how to rate this horror movie. obviously it deserves about a 7 for the refreshing and fun camera angles and close ups... however the story turns the images into things that you try and forget mostly...sorry sadism is not my bag a depressing couple hours. this is all a pity as dolan (director main actor tom) is clearly very intelligent. this is a director capable of a 9 rated movie (i grade tough)the director stuck in a couple queeny parts that didn&#x27;t fit...the tango scene in the barn. he needs to control that. another negative is after the funeral the thing moves too slowly... bisexual characters are usually an anthema for gays...and the plot reveals that the dead lover was bisexual and a cheater...yes i will stick with the 1 rating. not a gay friendly movie except the hero escapes.again the camera angles and close ups were fun...in this entirely local scene(quebec) filmed movie. some of the &#x22;helicopter views of a car&#x22; were probably digital wizardry but the rest was completely authentic.i don&#x27;t like movies where there is any possibility they may have killed an animal for the film. there were a couple scenes in this thing of dead looking cows...however i have to believe that canada would not allow this.if i had been tom the first facial slap from the francis would have had me out of there fast. but the story is believable. was it entertaining? not really was glad when it was over.overall this director is clearly talented and has what it takes to turn out interesting movies...is he a genius?...some of the camera stuff really impressed me. i hope he latches onto better stories.oh one final comment... was the anti-american slap at the very end needed? we are a large potential audience. he has francis take off his coat and wear a levi-jacket with an american flag and usa on it as he closes in for the kill. numerous closeups of this. although not fatal it helps nothing: je parle fran&#xe7;ais j&#x27;habite en colorado et j&#x27;adore les qu&#xe9;b&#xe9;cois.do not recommend this movie but dolan has great potential.. will look for other films he has done. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
