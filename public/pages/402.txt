edit did you know? trivia while in production, writer-director tom holland was stricken with bells-palsy, a virus which paralyzed half of his face. the effects could have been minimized if he'd gotten a steroid immediately - but the producers insisted he kept working, so it was 36 hours before he got to a doctor. it took more than a year and a half for holland to fully recover, the result of which was the end his hollywood career for a decade. see more &raquo;
