(fyi, douglas is joy's son -- thus c.s. lewis step-son -- played by joseph mazzello in this film.) i had recently seen shadowlands, and so i asked douglas how &quot;true to life&quot; the picture was. he told me that some details (dates, places) had been changed slightly for obvious dramatic/story-telling reasons, but that the &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;feeling&quot; of all the emotions portrayed in the movie were perfectly accurate. that's exactly what it all felt like, he said.i own the movie (and the soundtrack), and have seen it a dozen times... and i still get teary-eyed at the scene where douglas and jack cry in each other's arms... this movie rates a perfect 10 from me; i can't find any fault with it at all. 15 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 86 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: desmond arding arnold dopliss harry harrington bob chafer nick farrell christopher riley rupert parrish college president jack lewis claude bird peter whistler frith lieven standish ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
