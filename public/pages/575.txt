trivia early in the movie, when carrie (michelle forbes) and brian (david duchovny) first see early grayce (brad pitt) and adele corners (juliette lewis), carrie is heard complaining to brian, "they look like a couple okies." brad pitt was born in oklahoma. an "okie" is someone from oklahoma. in the 1930s it became a term of disparagement referring to the large number of very poor migrants from oklahoma, and nearby states, who fled the poverty of the dust bowl and the great depression by moving to california, mostly by automobile along u.s. route 66. the four main characters drive through the southwest u.s. generally following the path of the now decommissioned route 66. see more &raquo; goofs we first see early's pistol laying in a bag on the car's back seat. a closeup clearly shows it to be a parkerized u.s. military world war ii m1911a1 (with commercial grip panels). but later, when early and brian are firing it at an abandoned building, early says it's a japanese pistol. see more &raquo; quotes adele corners: i like your hair 'cause it's short. see more &raquo; connections referenced in yes man&nbsp;(2008) see more &raquo; soundtracks are you strong enough written by sheryl crow, david ricketts, kevin gilbert, bill bottrell, david baerwald, brian macleod performed by sheryl crow courtesy of a&amp;m records, inc. see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what are the differences between the r-rated and unrated version?

(pardon my arnold schwarzenegger)...this movie was completely ignored when released back in '93, and that's a shame. it's a great, suspenseful two hour road-trip that certainly opened my eyes to see that brad pitt was indeed an actor. he looks like he took took the 'method-acting' thing seriously, as with his appearance in true romance, i doubt he took even one shower in 1992.duchovny &amp; forbes were also fine as the normal half of this &quot;ride share from hell&quot;, but i'm guessing juliette lewis' naive &quot;jailbait&quot; turned off a few people (see nbk or cape fear for further proof). just ignore her grating &amp; whiny delivery, and go along for the wild ride all the way to kalifornia. 42 of 58 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 156 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: teenage girl driver peter eric old man parole officer john diebold carol police officer little girl middle aged farmer ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
