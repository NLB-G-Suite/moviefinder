(one of the wonders of the first is realizing that sinatra -could- act, that he did things with rhythm and cadence because those were his only tools, and it worked. he was no method actor, but damn.) streep's scenery chewing is frankly, perfect, because unfortunately, really disgusting people actually do exist, and the real ones are impervious to the critique that their behavior is over-the-top. seen or heard any fox commentators recently? streep's senator may be over-the-top, but the only thing that distinguishes her from the real thing is - surprise - she's only acting.make no mistake, both these films are paranoid thrillers, and the overly literal would say of either, &quot;preposterous&quot;. but then, the overly literal don't usually get much out of anything that isn't underlined in business week with a magic marker. so if you fit in that category, go rent something less threatening.on the other hand, if you are the nervous type...the film's style is less dialog laden, it runs more on mood. but it really does kick in all the same places, the same incredible cynicism offset by the thinnest sliver of a wild, earnest patriotism. 39 of 70 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 367 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: eddie ingram robert baker owens villalobos wilson atkins jameson laurent tokar boy scout #1 boy scout #2 scout dad scoutmaster ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
