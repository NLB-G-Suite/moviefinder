awww, the 80's :) 27 july 2005 | by lilcutie18613 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews adam sandler plays robbie hart, a wedding singer with only enough money to get by. he was going to get married, but linda, his fianc&eacute;', doesn't show up, and finally confronts him saying that she was having second thoughts. drew barrymore plays julia sullivan, a shy girl engaged to the wrong man. they meet when julia is waitressing at the place robbie works at. they are instantly friends and get along quite well.this simple plot is expanded by the great and memorable characters and the actors who portray the roles. it is funny and has plenty of memorable lines. and if this isn't enough for you to shout &quot;wahoo!&quot; the chemistry between julia and robbie is right on and i'm surprised they aren't dating in real life. this is a great romantic comedy so just watch it without any questions! it has become one of my favorites. 26 of 30 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
