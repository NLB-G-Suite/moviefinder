user reviews &nbsp; flimsy, far-fetched, but spunky and attractive 11 may 2002 | by moonspinner55 (las vegas, nv) &ndash; see all my reviews sandra bullock is very appealing as an unloved independent systems analyst who unknowingly gets hold of a disk that could bring worldwide chaos; pretty soon, she&#x27;s dodging bad guys, running from the cops and putting her allies in danger (including dennis miller, who is surprisingly good). despite a penchant for filming mouths in close-up, irwin winkler has directed a very fast, fun technical-thriller in which charming bullock is bounced from one nightmare to another. i loved the way she gets out of a building swarming with security: she dons a fireman&#x27;s outfit and escapes, but then the bad guys see a nicely piled fireman&#x27;s outfit (and helmet!) sitting on the sidewalk and yell, &#x22;she&#x27;s getting away!&#x22; just one example of how this movie is so completely brainless, but yet entertaining enough on a non-think level that you tell yourself not to notice. you&#x27;ll hate yourself in the morning, though. **1/2 from **** 19 of 32 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
