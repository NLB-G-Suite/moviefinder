see all my reviews the inkwell reminds me of two other films about the problems facing african american youths coming of age. they are cooley high(1976) and boyz 'n the hood. while not as violent ridden as boyz nor as touching as cooley high, this film none the less drives home the same point: growing up a teenager is hard enough, being a black teenager can be even more difficult. i would like to see a film about the challenges facing african american youths growing up in the new century with the same focus and intensity of these three excellent films. 1 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
