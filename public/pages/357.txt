trivia there is a scene in the film where harry donovan finds out about the death of his father (played by rod steiger) from heart failure in a newspaper clipping. the date of death given was tuesday, july 9. rod steiger died five years later on tuesday, july 9, 2002 of pneumonia and kidney failure. see more &raquo; goofs the sound effect used for the british police cars was inaccurate. british police cars did once sound like that but that was over twenty years ago. they now sound similar to american police vehicles. see more &raquo; quotes harry donovan: when are you gonna realize that all of this art crap is a fraud? otherwise, how could the same picture be worth $10 million or zip based on, what, a signature? rembrandt is priceless. donovan is worthless. that's not art. that's autographs. see more &raquo; connections referenced in an interview with john ottman&nbsp;(2002) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; it&#39;s different, but like the fake painting you know it could be better 8 october 2006 | by ccthemovieman-1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews although sometimes way too slow-moving and not as involving as it should have been, this film was almost a &quot;keeper&quot; in my collection.the story was different, and i liked it, about an artist producing a fake rembrandt. jason patric, an interesting and underrated actor, played the role on the con &#39;artist,&#39; so to speak. appealing-looking irene jacob, played the female lead. she was likable, unlike patric&#39;s character.there are some interesting moments in this film, particularly for those who love art. there also are a few nice shots of jacob that should please most male viewers. overall, nothing that super but decent and worth a rental. it&#39;s different, i&#39;ll say that.....but don&#39;t expect a lot. 15 of 24 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
