trivia in 1993 bill murray reflected, "i'm still a little queasy that i actually made a movie where i carry a machine gun. but i felt if you were rescuing your friends it was okay. it wasn't reds (1981) or anything, but it captured what it was like on an army base: it was cold, you had to wear the same green clothes, you had to do a lot of physical stuff, you got treated pretty badly, and had bad coffee". see more &raquo; goofs in the scene where the recruits are being measured for their uniforms and winger apologizes to sgt hulka for his earlier wisecrack, the unit crests on the epaulets of sgt hulka&#39;s field jacket disappear and reappear depending on the camera angle. see more &raquo; quotes [after stumbling on the sidewalk] captain stillman: have that removed. see more &raquo; crazy credits four actors with the first name "john", are listed back -to-back in the final credits: john candy, john larroquette, john voldstad and john diehl. see more &raquo; connections referenced in family guy: spies reminiscent of us&nbsp;(2009) see more &raquo; soundtracks rubberband man written by thom bell and linda creed (uncredited) performed by the spinners courtesy of atlantic records see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what are the differences between the theatrical version and the extended cut? see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; extremely funny movie, another bill murray classic 20 february 2005 | by c. nye (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews everyone is funny in this film. every performance is first-rate and each character adds something to the humor of this movie.stripes begins with bill murray losing his job, his car and his girlfriend all in the same day. his buddy harold ramis is also leading a lackluster life teaching the english language to foreigners who know only curse words. these depressing circumstances set the stage for murray to convince ramis to come with him and join the army.basic training, a hard-ass drill sergeant, female military police and naked mud wrestling consume the rest of this hilarious film. anyone who appreciates smart-ass humor should see this. however murray and ramis are the focal point of most of the humor in stripes and are very easy to relate to. also stars john candy, p.j. soles, sean young, john larroquette and judge reinhold. 14 of 22 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
