user reviews &nbsp; a glutted hollywood train wreck 5 march 2015 | by willhaskew (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews video games make horrible movies. this schlock was based on the most popular 2d fighting game of its day and was gobbled up by hollywood. it diverged highly from the game story line (which admittedly was not very well suited to a live action film) with b-movie martial arts actor jean claude van damme as guile, the special ops soldier from the usa, as commander of a u.n.- like group of peace keeping soldiers fighting m. bison (vega), dictator of a small nation called shadaloo. it doesn&#x27;t help any there&#x27;s no mention of any tournament and ryu, street fighter ii&#x27;s real protagonist, is demoted to a glorified cameo along side ken masters. characters like balrog, t. hawk, blanka and dhalsim are all after thoughts as well. when you think about how ridiculous just the attempt to portray blanka (think the incredible hulk with lou ferrigno cheesy) was, one has to wonder why they made a film at all? for some reason they also attempted to combine blanka and charlie from the street fighter alpha series together into one character. if you believe the wikipedia article about this movie, van damme and raul julia&#x27;s salaries ate up most of the $35 million budget (hard to believe mr. spinning side kick of death made $8 million for this crap). van damme was also notoriously carrying on an affair during production with co-star kylie minogue while his then-wife was pregnant. sadly raul julia made his final movie appearance in a throwaway role as m. bison. conclusion is that this was a giant greedy cash grab by capcom. there are some supernatural elements missing like bison&#x27;s psycho power or ryu&#x27;s hadouken technique which given the aggressive filming schedule, the cobbled together screenplay and bad casting choices would&#x27;ve probably looked horrendous in this movie any how. it&#x27;s a movie to avoid for most unless you are feeling extra nostalgic, a first time viewer who isn&#x27;t bored easily or maybe just a hardcore street fighter fan. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
