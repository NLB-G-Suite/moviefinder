fascinating 27 november 2000 | by ruthgee (darien, ct.) &ndash; see all my reviews i watched this movie on the t.v. and i think if i had seen it in a theatre i would have rated it higher than 7. it is a fascinating story, beautifully told. the atmosphere created was wonderful. the story is tragic. the early childhood of zhongliang was horrifying, as was the life led by the pang family,addicted to opium; the cruelty shown him by his sister and brother-in-law truly shaped zhongliang's character. part of the movie is set in shanghai in about the 1920's seemed real. it is a sad tale of corruption and cruelty. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
