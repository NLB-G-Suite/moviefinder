artaud says, and we already understand that artaud is on the verge of dying a physical death. sami frey, who plays artaud, is simply extraordinary and there is no hint that this man is an actor, this man is artaud, everything he says, whether it be random missives on the nature of evil in a fly or movements with his hands, eyes and intense caricature of the face, realizes artaud&#x27;s living frenzy. the scenes are bleak, and the whole film is in black and white with a grainy quality which is simply perfect for the mood. we don&#x27;t know if artaud inspires the poet but at the end, jacques writes, &#x22;i knew antonin artaud, he is the only man i loved . .. &#x22; and with that we realize that one of the greatest figures of man had such a supreme power of words that he will be sorely missed. long live artaud. 8 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see one user review&nbsp;&raquo;
