trivia apart from the electronic tonalities composed by louis barron and bebe barron, the music score known to many as "forbidden planet fanfare - parts 1 & 2" on the original 1956 theatrical trailer was composed by andré previn, and pieced together seamlessly by an mgm music editor. the music was originally written by previn for the mgm films scene of the crime (1949) and bad day at black rock (1955). see more &raquo; goofs when the monster is burning/melting the metal door, as it turns white hot and lumps start to fall, you can see a member of the crew in a heatproof suit prodding the material from behind to make it fall. watch the second and third holes for movement behind the door. then again, this motion could be taken to be the monster doing the poking... see more &raquo; quotes dr. edward morbius: guilty! guilty! my evil self is at that door, and i have no power to stop it! see more &raquo; connections featured in svengoolie: forbidden planet&nbsp;(1995) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what is the "id"?
