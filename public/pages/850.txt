is great and works well even on multiple viewings - there's no cheating here, it works well even when you know it and can see it coming. i love it to bits, and it's tremendous fun. criminally underrated. the cast is terrific, especially deborah foreman, and it's the first thing other than the back to the future movies that i've seen thomas f wilson in! and he's funny and likable in it too. gorehounds needn't bother, but if you like a good story and a good mystery you'll have a ball. it's quite possibly the only slasher movie that will appeal to people who hate slasher movies! i adore it. 23 of 35 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
