danny nucci 22 august 2006 | by renatacantada (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i think i recall seeing danny nucci in the kid&#39;s show &quot;hey dude&quot; years ago, and he sure has grown up! he&#39;s hot! he is what made watching this movie worthwhile........ the premise of the movie is pretty lame and unbelievable, but lara flynn boyle was lovely (this was before she lost so much weight). this must have been an early movie for peter dobson as well, i believe i&#39;ve seen him in some other things since then. luca bercovici as henry mulhill was a wholly unlikeable character so you don&#39;t feel too bad for what goes on with him. teresa dispina as cece was a salty/sassy pleasure to watch. i would have liked to have her with more dialog in the movie. again, unless you want to see danni nucci as a romantic lead (as i did), i would totally pass on this movie. 1 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
