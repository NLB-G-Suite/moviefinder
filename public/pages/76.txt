(*and possible spolier!*) 31 may 2001 | by smee3469 &ndash; see all my reviews i read &quot;the firm&quot; after watching it, not knowing what expect (i didn't know if it would be a tight or loose adaptation). it was pretty close, with the difference mainly lying in the ending, and that where sydney pollack makes this story go from good to great: the book, at the end, makes mitch out to be a coward and a traitor at the end, by making him give into the fbi. but, in the film, mitch is seen as a hero who doesn't give into anyone. the fbi doesn't win and the mafia doesn't win. mitch wins. he bows down to no one. tom cruise also plays a *great* mitch mcdeere, with a lot of intensity and charisma. you cheer for him as the protagonist. holly hunter is top-notch with her portrayal of the vulnerable, secretary turned accomplice tammy. gene hackman is also great as avery tolar, the one bad guy who sympathizes with mitch and abby. such a great screen presence. his scenes while they're in the kaymen islands are key ones to watch. jeanne tripplehorn finally makes up for her role in &quot;basic instinct&quot; as abby mcdeere, the &quot;cheated wife&quot;, not only by her husband, but also by the firm he works for. sydney pollack showcases some of his best work as director, especially by the opening segment that describes mitch mcdeere perfectly in the span of less than 10 minutes. such a great adaptation, and a even better film to watch! 19 of 23 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 146 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
