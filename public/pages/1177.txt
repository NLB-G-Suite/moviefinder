it is a friendship between two different men in spite of their sexuality difference. around 1979 cuban governments's oppressions toward homosexuals. 15 december 2005 | by steuern (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews fresa y chocolatei liked to watch fresa y chocolate; this is first cuban movie i've seen. fresa y chocolate is a product of two directors, tom&aacute;s guti&eacute;rrez alea and juan carlos tab&iacute;o in 1993. fresa y chocolate was nominated in 1995 the best foreign film. during the production of this film the director alea had cancer and for this reason tab&iacute;o had to help him to complete the movie. later 1996 alea die. this movie expresses the oppression of cuban government toward the homosexual and the conflict also the friendship within two different men. around 1997 in cuba,diego (jorge perugorria ) the main character is a cultured gay and david (vldimir cruz) a young revolutionary college student. he is a naive and dogmatic. the story begins at a cheap hotel room where david and his sweetheart, vivian tried to have first intimate experience together but ended up angry at each other, later vivian marries to a much older man who is in the government office position. david, the wedding day feeling low come to an ice cream shop near by school and over there david and diego meet. at the begging, it was diego's attempt to allure david but soon it change and in spite of their sexuality, these two different men establish a true friendship. most of story take a place at diego's apartment where full of things (art work, forbidden books, pictures...) for david's eye. it is a new and different world for david, a dogmatic and in a way an ignorant. diego tells david about his anguish and problem toward the government. for him being homosexual hinder his work in cuba and also his well being, too.however, david learns much about art and literature from diego and moreover, he learn how to enjoy and savor life. the message of this movie is tolerance. no matter what is one's sexuality people have genuine heart. they have hope, dreams, and frustration that life brings us.i think this movie is worth to watch because fresa y chocolate gave me a chance to give a glance to cuba, the country that i don't know yet. to me watching a good film lessens a tension of life. 8 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
