bad. 11 february 2004 | by sparrow_in_flight (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews sadly, the running joke of engywook and urgl having to go to the bathroom, but being unable to do so, is one of the entertaining things about this film. but it does get tiresome. and the baby rock-biter is cute, if incredibly stupid. but if you have ever seen the first movie, or read the book, you will most likely not care for this movie at all. the plot is poor, falcore looks extremely cartoonish as do the rockbiters, and the nasties...well, they just aren't that scary. give me gmork any day, please!this is a tolerable children's movie only if you have no other knowledge of the neverending story. 20 of 23 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
