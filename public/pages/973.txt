edit did you know? trivia most of the boat scenes for this movie were shot in hopewell, va at the marina, which is southeast of richmond and right off the james river. they attached large flood lights on the 2 lane bridge over the river and filmed the scene from a private houseboat that the director paid for a second story built onto that house boat. he did this to get a higher angle for the shots and also paid the owners for the use of their house boat for the entire shoot. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews bobby bishop's role in the white house was never made clear, but when they needed him, they sent a helicopter, and he arrived in a conference room full of suits still wearing his sweaty princeton sweatshirt. once he cleaned up and put on his own suit, bishop went before the press to clear up a public relations problem--after reminding a certain congressman what could happen if said congressman didn't help.a secret meeting with prof. pochenko promised to reveal something not quite kosher in the white house. but a man with a gun wanted the information to stay secret. so bishop spent the rest of the movie on the run and trying to uncover secrets with the help of washington herald reporter amanda givens. meanwhile, someone was capable of monitoring pretty much every phone call that took place in the movie.i like charlie sheen better as a womanizing jerk, but he was just fine here. both sheen characters know how to scheme and lie and otherwise be quite charming to get what they want. donald sutherland did a credible job as the white house chief of staff who didn't have faith in the president's ability. and sam waterston didn't exactly inspire confidence as the president. linda hamilton was good as amanda. this wasn't a great action thriller, but it was good nevertheless. too violent for my taste (and there was a stern warning on the tv station i watched, even after the movie was cleaned up for tv), but i enjoyed the chases and the occasional comedy. 8 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
