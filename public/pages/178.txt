edit did you know? trivia kurtz reads from the t.s. eliot poem "the hollow men." eliot was inspired to write this poem by "heart of darkness" by joseph conrad, the book on which this movie was loosely based. the first line of the poem reads, "mistah kurtz - he dead." kurtz leaves this line and the following line out when he reads. also, the photojournalist says, "this is the way the fucking world ends. look at this fuckin' shit we're in, man. not with a bang, but with a whimper, and with a whimper, i'm fucking splitting, jack." this is taken from the same poem's famous last two lines, "this is the way the world ends. not with a bang but with a whimper." see more &raquo;
