or is it just another escape? safe is a very interesting film about a woman so overwhelmed by her environment that she becomes allergic to it. writer and director haynes has combined aspects of the disease film (e.g. love story) with the psychological thriller &#150; as carol doesn't know what triggers her symptoms, the audience never knows when she'll have another attack.while haymes criticises the new age belief that illness is psychologically-based, in carol's case, it's impossible to separate the psychological and physical aspects of her illness. the cinematography shows her dwarfed by her environment and haymes offers no easy solutions. ***&frac12;/***** stars. 16 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
