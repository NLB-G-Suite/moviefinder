frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; sublime dancing, hilarious comedy, art deco time capsule 5 june 1999 | by jacksflicks (hollywood) &ndash; see all my reviews it's astounding that this all-time classic doesn't get a better average score.nureyev said astaire was the greatest dancer in the world, and astaire is at his best here with his best partner, ginger rogers. no need to elaborate, just watch them in action.erik rhodes should have got best supporting oscar. he was also wonderful in top hat, but it's here he gets to say the immortal line, &quot;your wife is safe with tonetti, he prefers spaghetti.&quot;the clothes and the decor evoke an ideal of courtship as aesthetic rather than as rutting, as it is today. elegance, grace and wit give even the silliest scenes more dignity than anything, fatuous &quot;talents&quot; can concoct today.some call the plot banal, but i think it's funny and inventive. sure it's mistaken identity, which is indeed a clich&eacute;, but so what? it's what they do with it that matters. a professional co-respondent??? of course it's silly but hey, that's what farce is. and this musical farce is one of the very best. 24 of 26 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
