a bizarre acid trip of a film that has good and bad points 20 october 2003 | by filmotaku (ssampon@hotmail.com) (milwaukee, wi) &ndash; see all my reviews oliver stone seems to have outdone himself on this one. not only is natural born killers a visual masterpiece, but it is probably one of the most insane and nonsensical social commentary films i have ever seen. disappointing, since it was penned by one of my favorite film directors, mr. quentin `bad motherf***er' tarantino himself. the elements of a good story are there: boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and go on a mass murdering spree which is lapped up by the media. while there is definitely a strong social statement, the story is too erratic and scattered to be completely coherent. visually however, natural born killers is stunning. it is intensely colorful, unflinchingly violent and innovative in its cinematography. this movie is not for most, but if you decide to try it out, be warned: it is not for the faint of heart, and not for the weak of stomach. but it is an important film for its visual merits, at the very least.--shelly 92 of 144 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
