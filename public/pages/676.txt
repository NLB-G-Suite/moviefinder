a cool $4million.the script had been knocking around hollywood for a decade before it was dusted down and given a green light. it was originally to star dustin hoffman (who signed up for petersen's follow up, outbreak). british director michael apted (the world is not enough) was due to direct the hoffman version, but when david puttnam took over as the head of columbia in 1987, the movie was put on hold.producer jeff apple (a man more known in the trade for his interactive shopping shows than films) brought in jeff maguire to polish up the script.the idea of horrigan as an agent who failed to stop jfk's untimely death gave the movie a twist that hollywood execs found delicious.before long, there was a feeding frenzy over the new, improved script and eventually, rob reiner's castle rock company snapped it up for a million dollars with clint eastwood on board.petersen had wanted harrison ford, but eventually cast him as the president in air force one (which you may remember was the film of the week a couple of weeks ago).as any clint fan knows, he's a jazz fan - a passion shared by horrigan in what seemed to be a tailor made role adapted for old mr squinty after he signed on the dotted line.however, frank's love of piano and jazz was already on the page - a happy accident which helped turn horrigan into one of clint's most likeable big screen characters.top drawer stuff. 32 of 42 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
