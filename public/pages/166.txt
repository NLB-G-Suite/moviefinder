goofs after lancelot rescues galahad from castle anthrax, a crew member is briefly visible shortly after the knights go around an outside corner of the castle, just before the scene ends (look on the left side of the screen). since breaking the fourth wall does not serve a humorous purpose here, it is a goof. see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; wonderful movie! 28 november 2004 | by marac-1 (farmington, mn) &ndash; see all my reviews this is such a great film that a professor of mine actually used it in a medieval civilization class as extra credit. this was not because the movie was so historically accurate, but because the movie was so much funnier when we applied what we learned in her class to it! it was really hard to pick only 10 funny lines!to anyone that watched it once and didn't quite get it or got frustrated the first time, here is a tip: catch it on dvd with the subtitles or closed-captioning on. that way you will be sure to catch all of the french insults and the other one-liners that fly by so fast! i don't recommend doing that with kids in the room - my 7-year-old picked up a couple of words on the screen that he had missed previously...enjoy! 85 of 117 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
