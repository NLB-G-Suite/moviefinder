edit storyline john smith is an amoral gunslinger in the days of prohibition. on the lam from his latest (unspecified) exploits, he happens upon the town of jericho, texas. actually, calling jericho a town would be too generous--it has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have 'driven off all the decent folk.' smith sees this as an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honor.... written by tad dibbern &lt;dibbern_d@a1.mscf.upenn.edu&gt;

goofs the first time john smith puts on his holster and pistols, the grip frames are pointing behind him. this would make it very difficult for him to pull the weapons in a timely manner when needed. however, when the time comes minutes later for him to pull the weapons, the grips are facing in the appropriate position for a quick draw and shoot. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] john smith: it's a funny thing. no matter how low you sink there's still a right and wrong. you always end up choosing. you go one way so you can try to live with yourself. you go the other, you'd still be walkin' around, but you're dead and you don't even know it. see more &raquo;

frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; i loved this movie from the first time i saw it. 19 december 2004 | by anthony bannon (bannonanthony) (annalong, n. ireland) &ndash; see all my reviews i've become a big fan of walter hill's movies and this one is as good as ever. it's not a particularly cheery film, but it's still enjoyable. bruce willis and christopher walken are both terrific in their roles. walken plays as good a bad guy as ever, and willis is good as the ambiguous lead character.the gun battles are staged excellently and the music by ry cooder works very well with the picture. it's very much a guy film, though. there are only two women who play big parts in the film, but they don't appear very often.i give lms 7/10. it's a moody piece but enjoyable. 34 of 46 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
