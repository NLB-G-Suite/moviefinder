on video. since i liked what i saw, i then watched this full-length feature, which came nearly four decades after the birth of the stop-motion character&#x27;s original tv show. &#x22;gumby: the movie&#x22; was not a disappointment for me, and the first time i watched it during my childhood wasn&#x27;t my last. i have watched it again three times, i think all within the past year, and thought it was pretty good the first couple times, but it went slightly downhill for me with my latest viewing. while i watched &#x22;gumby: the movie&#x22; last night, i wasn&#x27;t quite as impressed.in this movie, gumby is a member of a rock band called the clayboys. the band has a studio on a farm, where they rehearse. as the band are on their way to their studio, along with gumby&#x27;s friends (pokey, goo, and prickle), they learn that farmers are about to lose their homes, due to the fact that they cannot pay their debts. the clayboys decide to hold a benefit concert for these troubled farmers. unfortunately, the evil blockheads, the ones who delivered the letters to the farmers, informing them of the bad news, are at the concert. when these two notice gumby&#x27;s dog, lowbelly, crying pearls, they begin to record the music. after the show, the blockheads kidnap lowbelly, so they can play the recording they have of the clayboys&#x27; music, and have him cry more pearls so they can get rich! however, they discover that lowbelly will only cry pearls when he hears the music live, so the two villains now intend to kidnap the band members as well! &#x22;gumby: the movie&#x22; may have more for kids than for adults, but it&#x27;s not strictly for kids. during previous recent viewings, i certainly wasn&#x27;t blown away, but thought it reasonably entertaining, with some mild excitement, an occasional funny scene (such as the clumsy robot waiter in the caf&#xe9;), and some interesting places the characters find themselves in when they enter books. when i last watched the film, i was entertained by these things for a while, but eventually, i found that it got tiring. i also found that some of the voice-overs are poor, although most of them are alright. i don&#x27;t know, maybe i have now seen it too many times. however, since i liked the film more during previous viewings, and enjoyed a bit of it this time, i have to give it credit, and do recommend it for stop-motion fans of all ages. you just might not want to expect a masterpiece. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
