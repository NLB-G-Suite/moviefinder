see all my reviews the dwarf vincent prather (phil fondacaro) leads an expedition to the tierra del fuego following an ancient map. he arrives at a cave where there is a coffin instead of a treasure. he opens a box with four pieces of a heart and revives the mother of all vampires lilith (angie everhart) that kills his employees. vincent uses a key artifact with blood to control and protect himself from lilith.the punk caleb verdoux (corey feldman) has an argument with his sister katherine verdoux (erika eleniak ) and leaves their house to go to a bar to meet a friend. they learn that there is an amazing brothel at 325 beaumont, a funeral home where they should ask for the cunningham wake. they are received by the mortician mccutcheon (aubrey morris) and soon they go to the brothel. however lilith runs the place and the girls are vampires. caleb&#x27;s friend is killed by lilith that that rips his heart out of his chest and then caleb is attacked by her.katherine goes to the precinct to report that her brother is missing but the police officer does not give much attention to her. the private investigator rafe guttman (dennis miller) overhears her conversation and offers his services to katherine. the snoopy rafe tracks caleb&#x27;s path and he discovers that the brothel seems to be a lair of vampires. but katherine, who works with reverend current (chris sarandon) that has a business connection with lilith, does not believe in his word. now rafe is seeking evidences to prove to katherine that he is telling the truth. &#x22;bordello of blood&#x22; is an underrated gore comedy of vampires. the plot is funny, with beautiful and hot female vampires, and also with a great unexpected conclusion. the comedy is a funny parody of horror and crime genres with the sexy angie everhart and erika eleniak. but dennis miller steals the movie in the role of a sleazy but efficient private eye. lilith&#x27;s tongue reaching the heart of her victims is hilarious; however the funniest scene is when rafe teams up with reverend current and they use squirt guns with holy water to defeat the female vampires, exploding them. when the viewer expects a happy ending, with the good guy and the good girl together, there is an unforeseen conclusion. my vote is seven.title (brazil): &#x22;o bordel de sangue&#x22;
