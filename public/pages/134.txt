user reviews &nbsp; the order of the universe 7 february 2000 | by tapio ylinen (tapioylinen@yahoo.com) (kuopio, finland) &ndash; see all my reviews i spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way i observe the universe. it changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. and after reading the novel (by arthur c. clarke) i found myself once again inspired (a writer as i am) by the level of imagination.the space odyssey is not something one can just &quot;go and see&quot;. one has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. in fact i don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. it is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'also spracht zarathustra' by richard strauss and 'blue danube' by johann strauss.take all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. if it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.or maybe i'm just plain crazy... 398 of 662 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
