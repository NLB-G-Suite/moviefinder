see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; a few good scenes don&#x27;t save this wreck of a story. 5 june 2010 | by samiam3 (canada) &ndash; see all my reviews there are moments in spawn that stand out with exceptional creativity, but what truly stands out about the movie is just how much of a mess it is. the screenplay is a wreck, the acting is stiff and unconvincing, and the whole thing seems to fly by so fast, that we don&#x27;t get a chance to experience much other than a look at some nifty visuals. in fairness, i suppose it is easy enough to argue that spawn delivers its share of action sequences for a ninety minute movie, but perhaps it needs to back down a bit. it needs more story. in the end, spawn feels like nothing more or less than an exercise in cgi and make-up effects.it is pretty difficult to get involved with the story, in part because it makes no sense, but mostly because we simply do not care. the character of al simmons is about as cheap and plastic as the armour he suits up in during the second half of the feature. quite frankly i don&#x27;t find him all that likable. he is cold and nasty, even as a superhero. i really hate it when the good guys talk like the bad guys; when they cackle or make snarly remarks, like dr. westlake in the darkman series. some of the special effects work, some don&#x27;t. our hero has a blood red cape which can expand to the size of texas (don&#x27;t ask me how). i liked that effect. the thing sort of has a computer generated life of its own, and its elegance clashes with the plastic of spawn&#x27;s armour. the primary villain is a clown from hell, who can turn into a ten foot armour plated beast which looks a bit like a cousin of the queen from aliens. that is another good effect. the climax takes us deep into the fiery pit of hell, which unfortunately does not so convincing. my screen saver is a more intimidating computer generated image. i was reminded a bit of the brinstar level from super smash brothers. like so many films do, spawn ends on a note that just cries out for a sequel. needless to say, there isn&#x27;t one and there never will be. spawn is entertaining in parts, but definitely not as a whole. in more competent hands, this could have worked....but it doesn&#x27;t 10 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
