user reviews &nbsp; shallow pulpy romance/suspense/mystery 3 november 2006 | by mstomaso (vulcan) &ndash; see all my reviews decent acting doesn&#39;t salvage this poorly scripted, over-sexed, story of a 30-something woman (stone) who seems to make all of the worse possible choices in places to live and boyfriends. &quot;sliver&quot; is the beautiful but apparently haunted (or at least dangerous) apartment building she moves into on the rebound from a lengthy failed relationship. vulnerable, stone is almost immediately courted by her new neighbors - berenger and baldwin. inexplicably, she doesn&#39;t even consider moving when she learns that several unresolved murders, suicides or accidental deaths have occurred in the building, including the former occupant of her own room who looked just like her. both of her suitors are creepy and seem about as trustworthy as politicians, and it appears likely that at least one of them has committed some terrible crimes.this film must have made a better grade b mystery/suspense novel than a movie. not having read the book, i can only guess based on my experience with the pulp mystery genre that the film follows its plot closely. all of the main characters seem to be either sex addicts, perverts or impotent men, and this provides an opening for too many boring and unnecessary sex scenes. i suppose these were meant to fill in the gaps left by the vacuous plot and the uninspired script.in terms of mystery, sliver&#39;s central plot succeeds, as it does (somewhat but not completely) keep you guessing right up to the end. however, the plot would have made a much better 30 minute or hour-long episode of a tv detective show (minus the sex). sliver is overloaded with baggage and filler - too many sex scenes, a little too much character development (especially considering how shallow, irrational and absurd most of the characters are) and not enough psychological realism.overall, i found the film slightly entertaining, but a little difficult to get all the way through. 17 of 28 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
