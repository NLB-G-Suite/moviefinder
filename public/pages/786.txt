trivia at charlie and muriel's divorce proceedings, muriel has had a breast augmentation. they are rosie perez's real breasts. she had to have them bound down for the first half of the movie, to appear smaller. see more &raquo; goofs when yvonne files for bankruptcy in the beginning, she files in new york civil court. people file for bankruptcy in united states bankruptcy court which is a federal court. civil court where she filed is a state court. bankruptcy is governed by federal laws, and therefore bankruptcy cases would be heard in federal as opposed to state court. see more &raquo; quotes angel dupree: [narrating] tonight, i had the opportunity to study grace and generosity under the direst of circumstances. even in "their darkest hour", officer charlie lang and the good-hearted ms. yvonne biasi shared a bowl of soup with me. when i left, this good samaritan gave me money from his own pocket, wishing it could be more. see more &raquo; crazy credits this film was inspired by the generosity of detective robert cunningham (ret.) and his wife, gina. mr. and mrs. cunningham have been happily married for 31 years. the waitress and her husband have been happily married for 37 years. see more &raquo; connections remade as bade dilwala&nbsp;(1999) see more &raquo; soundtracks round of blues written by shawn colvin and larry klein performed by shawn colvin see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; this is how a modern romantic comedy should look like 26 february 2006 | by floydianer (germany) &ndash; see all my reviews if you judge &quot;it could happen to you&quot; by its amount of realistic situations and characters, you&#39;ll probably give it a 4 out of 10. but, who cares about realism here? it&#39;s like a modern fairy tale, frank capra transported into the 90s. there&#39;s a wonderful storyline (cop gives waitress a 2 million dollar tip), which apparently is even based on real-life events. nicolas cage plays the most honest cop imaginable, and he proves he can play a romantic lead role just as well as a dramatic action/thriller one. his character is not exactly 100 percent realistic, but that&#39;s not a problem, this is hollywood for heaven&#39;s sake.even better than cage is his female leading lady: the fascinating bridget fonda. fonda is a wonderful actress who can play both a cute character like her waitress yvonne here and more challenging roles like the ladymacbeth-similar one in &quot;a simple plan&quot;. unfortunately she never had the career of a julia roberts but she is in fact more talented and better looking. throughout the whole movie she gives a good performance and looks gorgeous. if i had the choice of giving a waitress the lottery money or not and the woman looked like fonda i might even give it to her. of course there aren&#39;t so many waitresses out there that look (and behave) as charming as her and chances are low i&#39;ll ever win two millions in the lottery.also notable is the wonderful chemistry between cage and fonda. as for the supporting roles special mention has to go to perez. although you wonder why cage married her in the first place, she gives a humorous and entertaining performance. of course there&#39;s kitsch but that&#39;s not necessarily bad. good kitsch can be wonderful and this film, that has an absolutely great happy ending, serves as a perfect example of how a romantic comedy should be filmed. it&#39;s better than &quot;pretty woman&quot;. 18 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
