diaz strikes back! 1 june 2000 | by stirred_mind (new zealand) &ndash; see all my reviews i was pleasantly suprised with this movie, because i didn't expect it to be great. but it was, the film is smart, sexy, funny and thrilling. you'll love cameron diaz and the storyline is marvellous. black comedies don't get much better than this.diaz plays natalie, who is happily married to older-crinkly george (harvey keitel). everything is perfect until natalie's old boyfriend (billy zane) shows up while george is out on a fishing trip. as if sleeping with him isn't bad enough, natalie finds the guy dead and naked on a table. who knows what happened? our nat's doesn't have time to find out, she must hide the body and look ship-shape before george returns!unfortunately, keitel is miscast and should play natalie's father, and the story sometimes gets silly, but overall, thats the fun of it!my rating : 8/10. 10 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
