edit storyline with this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "el mariachi," director robert rodriquez joins the ranks of sam peckinpah and john woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. we pick up the story as a continuation of "el mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hitman and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. this time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. however, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown. written by tad dibbern &lt;dibbern_d@a1.mscf.upenn.edu&gt;

user reviews &nbsp; robert rodriguez's sequel-cum-remake of el mariachi. 16 august 2005 | by miyagis_sweaty_wifebeater (sirjosephu@aol.com) (sacramento, ca) &ndash; see all my reviews desperado (1995) was a fun and big budgeted version of desperado. robert rodriguez has fun with the film and the characters from el mariachi. antonio banderas stars as the mythical el mariachi whilst salma hayyek co-stars as his love interest. cheech marin, danny trejo, steve buscemi and quentin tarantino are among the other stars who make guest star appearances.el mariachi is hiding out in another small desert town. he's become a legendary vigilante who's still seeking out justice for his dead girlfriend. he has a companion (steve buscemi) who helps him out find those who were connected to the boss from the first film. during one of his hits, a hired gun from another crime family comes into town (danny trejo). he also fits the description of el mariachi (somewhat). a local book dealer (salma hayek) crosses paths with the legendary crime fighter. who is the man behind all of el mariachi's sorrow? why is he so desperate to single handedly trying to crush the crime in the area? how does he do it by himself? is he that good? to find out the answers for all of these questions you'll just have to watch desperado.a fun second parter to el mariachi. unlike most sequels, you don't need to watch the first film to enjoy this one. it's just another entertaining film that'll burn some time. enjoy!highly recommended. 28 of 38 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
