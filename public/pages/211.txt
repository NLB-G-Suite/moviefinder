trivia the music heard playing during the opening credits is "the little boy that santa forgot" performed by vera lynn. notably, the song is about a fatherless boy. featured on the album, the song "vera" is referring to another classic by vera lynn called "we'll meet again." its lyrics include: "we'll meet again, / don't know where, don't know when, / but i know / we'll meet again / some sunny day." see more &raquo; goofs when the young pink finds his father's service revolver and ammunition in his mother's bedroom, the ammunition has a metal jacket (i.e. the actual &quot;bullet&quot; part has a brass casing over it). when he dishes them out to his friends in the railway embankment the rounds are ordinary lead rounds without he brass casing. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] pink: [singing] so ya, thought ya might like to, go to the show. to feel the warm thrill of confusing that space cadet glow. tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
