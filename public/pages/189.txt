we all know the answer.well done, mr scorsese. regardless of what the pretentious fools responsible for the decisions that the academy makes, the people are fully aware of who the best director in town is.&quot;raging bull&quot; is flawless and perfect. 10 out of 10, all the way. 80 of 112 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
