see all my reviews joe pesci brings the best out of this film. the plot is ok, but pesci, as the eccentric (yet downtrodden) bum simon wilder, keeps it together. he is funny, heartwarming and good at what he does- and that is acting. brendan frasier is also good as the college harvard who find simon and makes the plot go around. usually funny, usually sad, ok in my book (if i have such a book). a 12 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
