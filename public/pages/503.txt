(1950). both characters succumb to their alter egos, and descend into their own worlds of fantasy and half-truths.in &quot;a streetcar named desire&quot;, blanche travels from her antebellum roots in mississippi to new orleans, to see her sister stella. but, upon arriving in the big easy, blanche must confront stella's husband stanley, a greasy, poker-playing neanderthal lout who knows a thing or two about reality. it's the clash between blanche's stately delusions and stanley's gritty realism that soups up the drama in this tennessee williams play, converted to film classic by director elia kazan.the drama is absorbing. but the performances of marlon brando and vivien leigh, as stanley and blanche, are what make the film the cinematic powerhouse that it is. excellent b&amp;w lighting and jazzy background music amplify the seedy, sleazy atmosphere, which adds depth and texture to the story and the acting. and, of course, the claustrophobic, steamy french quarter makes a perfect setting.as one would expect for a film derived from a play, &quot;a streetcar named desire&quot; is very talky. generally, i don't care for films burdened with a ten thousand page script. but this talk-fest is an exception. overwhelming what i would otherwise consider a weakness, the acting of brando and leigh alone are enough to justify a two hour investment, and render an enjoyable and memorable cinematic experience. 47 of 60 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 242 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: newspaper collector the doctor the mexican woman ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
