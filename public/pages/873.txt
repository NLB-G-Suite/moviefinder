sound). meanwhile, slick disc jockey kevin bacon (as billy magic) arrives in town (one step ahead of the law), to spin &#x22;sweaty collar and dirty fingernail music&#x22; on the local rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll radio station. mr. bacon is a payola player, who needs an underage kid to handle money illegal exchanges. when renfro cheats on a radio contest, bacon offers him big bucks to serve as &#x22;unwitting accomplice&#x22;... bacon swaggers through his role with perfection. and, renfro is incredible, in a very difficult role; capturing the vulnerability of youth, as he struggles to both adopt and resist bacon&#x27;s seductive persona. calista flockhart (as diney majeski) is very effective, as renfro&#x27;s &#x22;older woman&#x22; love interest. their performances should have received some award consideration. maximilian schell (as istvan jonas) would have been more believable as renfro&#x27;s grandfather, to support the obviously wider than envisioned cultural gap between the characters. a few of the scenes are silly, but many more work, due to director guy ferland and his convincing cast.&#x22;i make things up sometimes,&#x22; renfro reveals. don&#x27;t we all. &#x22;telling lies in america&#x22; certainly breaks no new ground - but, it revisits cinematic themes in great style. the film builds to a fine conclusion, and the music is terrific.******** telling lies in america (8/2/97) guy ferland ~ brad renfro, kevin bacon, calista flockhart, maximilian schell 3 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
