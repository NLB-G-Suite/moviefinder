quotes [first lines] christof: we've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions. we are tired of pyrotechnics and special effects. while the world he inhabits is, in some respects, counterfeit, there's nothing fake about truman himself. no scripts, no cue cards. it isn't always shakespeare, but it's genuine. it's a life. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews &quot;the truman show&quot; owes a lot to the direction of peter weir. weir refuses to pump out the movies in a search for extra dollars. instead he chooses wisely and directs brilliantly. just by looking at a list of his movies will surprise and even amaze you. so as you would imagine &quot;the truman show&quot; is another success.truman burbank has the perfect life, or so he thought until finally his life long suspicions about his world begin to unravel. even though the idea for truman is not totally original, it is thought provoking enough and allows the audience to wonder, what if? if you think this couldn't happen, just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think again.jim carrey once again nails his role, as do the entire cast. it is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre. this is something he does not receive enough credit for. acting for a comical role or a more dramatic role requires no less effort for the performance to be spot on. 94 of 116 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
