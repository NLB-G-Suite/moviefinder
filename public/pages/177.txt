edit did you know? trivia when alex is being drowned, there is a barely perceptible micro-cut in which malcolm mcdowell was able to use the oxygen mask that was hidden in the water. the bath was muddied by using bovril, a beef extract. see more &raquo; goofs many of the continuity errors are not in fact errors. stanley kubrick purposely included many continuity errors as a way of creating a feeling of disorientation for the audience. that is why people's positions change, props are reorganized, and hats (and other articles of clothing) appear and disappear. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] alex: there was me, that is alex, and my three droogs, that is pete, georgie, and dim, and we sat in the korova milkbar trying to make up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. the korova milkbar sold milk-plus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. this would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence. see more &raquo; crazy credits there are no opening credits after the title, which is followed by the opening shot of alex the droog. although it is now commonplace for major films to not have opening credits, in 1971 it was considered rather unusual and was considered a trademark of director stanley kubrick. see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; amazing, the greatest villain ever, nothing has scared me more 19 march 2005 | by bitpartmozart (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews i just saw this movie about a day ago, and it completely blew me away, namely the main character, protagonist, hero? alex. we love, hate, and or just plain utterly confused about how we feel of alex. alex is the greatest villain ever because he is ourselves, he is the worst of ourselves. hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surface eventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you. the way alex stares into the camera in the first scene just freaks me out, he has a little smirk on his face that seems to say you may hate me, but you'll never be rid of me, because there can never be good without the bad, and i am the bad. 200 of 306 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
