frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; a rare gem 13 may 1999 | by fubar-2 (boston, ma) &ndash; see all my reviews normally i do not like albert finney. in fact i think he's one of the most overrated actors in film (i suspect his style of acting works much better on stage). this movie was an exception. for once he played a real person, and, except for one or two scenes, managed to quench his desire to gnaw at the scenery. i found myself totally identifying with the lead character for once. all of the acting is very effective, and the story is believable. a rare thing in movies. this would be a good double bill for 'my beautiful laundrette'. odd that indian's present homosexuality believably in english films, but i have never scene an indian film even portray homosexuality (and, yes, i have seen many indian films). 8 of 18 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
