or maybe a better question, where is the unhappiness? at so many points in the story we imagine drama, expect it, that is how life comes to be, and yet at every point drama is waved away. we&#x27;d like to accept a life without regrets perhaps, but do we? immediately we have complete dismantling of the melodrama, but we have something else too.varda has filmed a story trusting that we&#x27;ll imagine all the other things, which she can leave out. she teases out only enough, a brief look of disappointment in the two women, the notion that she carried flowers down to the river. we inhabit both stories, the one we see, the other which we foreshadow behind appearances, so that all the tension becomes ours, internal. we strive to see the lying man, the betrayed wife, maybe we do. is this happiness? is it not? is it?there&#x27;s more than social critique here, make no mistake, or it wouldn&#x27;t haunt (even more than vertigo). it&#x27;s because it makes you walk, live, through your own mind all the way to heartbreaking betrayal and you can&#x27;t unlive it. in the end varda films the last part from the river onwards as if nothing has changed between the new pair, but something has. has it? does he grieve? does he not? who is it that tells you one or the other, or that it has to be one? or will you just see a painted parable?something to meditate upon. 5 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
