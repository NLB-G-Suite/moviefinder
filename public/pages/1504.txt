edit storyline the beans are poor, proud, hated by all, but alive in the sense that they struggle against their lot and support each other in time of trouble. earlene lives across the street from the bean's trailer, and the view from her window is better than any daytime television soap opera; especially beal bean, and especially beal bean shirtless. when reuben bean is sent to prison for resisting arrest for out-of-season deer hunting, beal takes up with reuben's woman roberta. he also has a child by earlene, with a triangle of sex complicated by poverty. written by bruce cameron &lt;dumarest@midcoast.com&gt;

dull and episodic 12 march 2000 | by mynerva &ndash; see all my reviews maybe if you're in the right mood, you can get into the rhythm of this movie, but episodic is the best description. no one story line feels really developed. characters come and go, make speeches and die, all to no effect. 5 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
