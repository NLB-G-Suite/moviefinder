trivia the world war i battle scenes, like the vietnam combat sequences in full metal jacket (1987) 30 years later, were not shot in authentic locations but were recreated in different geographic areas. for instance, this film was shot outside the village of pucheim, west of munich, germany. in fact, the entire movie was filmed in germany, even though it takes place along the western front in france. the soldiers' trial and execution were filmed in and around the schleissheim palace, just beyond the dachau concentration camp memorial. at the time the film went into pre-production, the era of "runaway" productions was in full swing in hollywood, when films often went to other countries to shoot because of cheaper labor costs and less government and union interference. see more &raquo; goofs as col. dax is running through the trenches after gen. mireau gives his order, a &quot;dead&quot; soldier blinks. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] narrator of opening sequence: war began between germany and france on august 3rd 1914. five weeks later the german army had smashed its way to within eighteen miles of paris. there the battered french miraculously rallied their forces at the marne river and in a series of unexpected counterattacks drove the germans back. the front was stabilized then shortly afterwards developed into a continuous line of heavily fortified trenches zigzagging their way five hundred miles from the english channel to the swiss ... see more &raquo; connections featured in at the movies: episode #10.25&nbsp;(2013) see more &raquo; soundtracks künstlerleben (artist's life), op.316 (1867) (uncredited) composed by johann strauss played as dance music at the party see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: is "paths of glory" based on a book?

it means there not afraid of getting killed, they're afraid of getting hurt. i think if you're gonna get shot and live, it's best to get shot in the rear than in the head. why? because in the rear its just meat, but the head, that's pure bone. can you imagine what it's like for a bullet to rip through pure bone?&quot; when i first saw this film in a theater, there was some nervous laughter in the audience during this scene. it's true, the scene's dark humour helps illustrate the insanity of the situation. in my introduction i stated that there was great use of irony in the film. perhaps the greatest irony is the title. in the end no one finds glory. dax, although he nobly fights to defend his men wrongly accused of treason, loses the fight. even though he is later offered a promotion, he turns it down because of his disgust for the army. mireau is found out to be the cad that he is for ordering his own troops slaughter, and is court marshalled. the film successfully states that in a war even the supposed victors lose something as well. 76 of 86 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
