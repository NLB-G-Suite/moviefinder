frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews skydivers, explosions and a sense of humor 14 april 2006 | by unbrokenmetal (hamburg, germany) &ndash; see all my reviews skydiver ditch brodie (charlie sheen) is asked for a lesson. the beautiful lady (nastassja kinski) he takes on the plane seems to fall to her death as the parachute doesn&#39;t open. brodie quickly finds out that she is alive and well, and gets into the middle of a conspiracy. soon he is chased by secret agents, gangsters, russians... everyone, really, and he doesn&#39;t know what for. what matters most to this movie is that it is moving fast, as its title suggested. and &quot;terminal velocity&quot; does well as an action movie with its stunts and explosions, if you compare it to others of the genre. also it has a certain sense of humor because of the unusual situation that the pretty lady perfectly knows the espionage business, while the hero just follows her footsteps and even has to ask her how he can fire a gun. it&#39;s not a bond, but sheen and kinski both have much less exciting films in their biography, so most watchers won&#39;t be disappointed. 9 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
