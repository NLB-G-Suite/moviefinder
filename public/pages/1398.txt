see all my reviews this film is of interest to fans who like films about law and lawyers because it can serve as the answer to the question &quot;what is the worst movie about lawyers ever made?&quot; the film takes every lawyer cliche and hauls it far over the top. the film is set in a law firm which is equivalent in manners and morals to a shark tank. it begins with a down-sizing in which the managing partner literally hauls an associate out of her office and throws her in the elevator. another disgruntled associate shoots up the joint. our heroine, an african american from harvard law school, with some semblance of ethics is trying to survive in this environment but can only do so if she can generate business. the plot degenerates into some nonsense which i gather has to do with digging up dirt on potential clients, then blackmailing them into retaining the lawyer. more and more people get shot, but most viewers, like myself, will have lost interest long before the film winds down. everything about the film is amateurish; the acting is comical and the screenplay sounds like a middle school writing project. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 5 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
