goofs in the last part of the movie, phil is seen playing the piano on stage at the party. as he finishes up song before going and talking to rita, the piano in the soundtrack is playing a glissando (running a finger rapidly down the keyboard) while phil is still playing as he was before. finally, at the last run, phil's hands match the sound. see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; best romantic comedy ever 16 december 2013 | by gogoschka-1 (wherever good films play) &ndash; see all my reviews * may contain spoilers *let&#x27;s face it: everyone&#x27;s a sucker for romantic comedies, but this one is something special. this movie has as much charm as it has bite, thanks to a fantastic script and murray&#x27;s excellent performance. never dull or cheesy, this wonderful fantasy tale just hits all the right notes, and if anyone knows a better rom-com, please name it. i mean: what other romantic comedies are there where the protagonist commits suicide and you just have to laugh?i&#x27;ve watched &#x27;groundhog day&#x27; countless times and, without a doubt, i will watch it again and again (or for as long as i keep waking up to that nerve-wrecking song by sonny &#x26; cher). priceless. my vote: 10 out of 10.favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/ 65 of 69 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
