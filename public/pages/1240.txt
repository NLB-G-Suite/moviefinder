(ajr@fortalnet.com.br) (fortaleza, cear&aacute;, brazil) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;total eclipses&quot; narrates the romance that is born among the poets paul verlaine (david thewlis, in a courageous and excellent performance, thewlis plays strong scenes with experience and professionalism) and arthur rimbaud (leonardo di caprio, before being thrown to the hollywood's stardom in &quot;titanic&quot;). the film documents, without make-ups,paul verlaine's slow destruction,a man who is consumed by the love and hate that he fells for rimbauld.director agniezka holland accomplished a touching and beautiful work,counting with a perfect plasticity that reconstitutes the time and the romance among the two men in a detailed way and without shame, what can,in fact,shock di caprio's fans in some delicate moments.even being a little slow in a lot of parts of the story, &quot;total eclipse&quot; is efficient when its seen as a drama that lectures about the difficulty of being homosexual, but besides this topic, it analyzes what happens when people abdicate of their happiness and suffer due to social conventions, and finally it ends up in a intelligent conclusion:that only through the courage and through the love it's possible not only to break such barriers but also to achieve redemption.director agnieszka holland conducts with experience a story that, in the hands of another director, could be reduced into a common and not very innovative denominator, and the lenses of her camera shows, without make-ups and courts to alleviate the impact of the scenes, the whole suffering, the prejudice and the pain that marks the relationship between rimbaud and verlaine. the two poets' love is realistically developed by holland, starting by the friendship, in which the two writers begin to know important things about theirselves and discover that they have a lot in common, in terms that both are unhappy with the path their lives acquired, the doubts, the fears and the frustrations,till the beginning of the romance. the scene in which the first kiss happens, when rimbauld seduces verlaine and tries to get closer to him and ease his nervousness,is strong,touching and beautiful,this decisive and provocative part is filmed and written in a sweet and human way. the focus that the production gives to the story, therefore,is natural and realistic, what can scare many people away of the box- offices for the context declaredly homosexual of the story.&quot;total eclipse&quot; explores and studies the relationship without making concessions and without allowing any demagogy or fear. there are rough scenes such as the one in which thewlis is tirelessly sodomized by di caprio, there are moments of fondness when the two kiss each other,but in the same way the sick and morbid aspect of the relationship is expressed, when, for example, rimbauld stabs rimbaud's hand to prove his love.being a heterosexual, i concluded that, instead of adopting a dogmatic and racist posture, it would be better if i could appreciate the film not as just another plot about two gay guys who are in love but i tried to enlarge my point of view, understanding that the film was, actually, a simple feeble love history marked by the suffering and resignation. thus, i recommend &quot;total eclipse&quot; as an intelligent and efficient drama, a work that deserves to be applauded by its initiative and courage, for the excellent performances and for the safe and kind work by agnieszka holland, who tells a love story in a distressing and realist form. &quot;total eclipses&quot; i rated for strong sexuality and nudity, language, and some startling violence and it runs 111 minutes.the cast: david thewlis, romane bohringer and leonardo di caprio. 25 of 35 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 79 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: isabelle rimbaud isabelle, as a child rimbaud's mother frederic vitalie mr. maute de fleurville carjat aicard charles cros the judge andre ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
