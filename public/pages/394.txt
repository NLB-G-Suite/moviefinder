trivia dennis hopper described the film's production - "it was a nightmare, very honestly, that movie. it was a husband and wife directing team who were both control freaks and wouldn't talk before they made decisions. anyway, i was supposed to go down there for five weeks, and i was there for 17. it was so over budget." see more &raquo; goofs after the brothers steal a police car the text on the side is momentarily reversed, showing the shot was mirrored. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] narrator: a long long time ago, the earth was ruled by dinosaurs. they were big, so not a lot of people went around hassling 'em. actually, no people went around hassling 'em cuz there weren't any people yet. just the first tiny mammals. basically, life was good. then something happened: a giant meteorite struck the earth. goodbye dinosaurs! but what if the dinosaurs weren't all destroyed?
