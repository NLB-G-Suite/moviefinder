trivia the song that o'malley sings when he first appears has several similarities to "the bear necessities" from the jungle book (1967). both were used as the introduction of a character, were written by terry gilkyson, and performed by phil harris. additionally other songs written for each film were written by richard m. sherman and robert b. sherman. the only exception of this is "ev'rybody wants to be a cat" which was written by floyd huddleston and al rinker. see more &raquo; goofs near the end, after george notices the music coming from elsewhere in the house, the scene changes to the alley cats playing their instruments and dancing. scat cat is two places at once - on the top of the piano with other cats (third from the right), and also on the floor in the bottom right of the screen. see more &raquo; quotes chinese cat: shanghai, hong kong, egg foo young / fortune cookie always wrong. oh, that a hot one! see more &raquo; crazy credits the opening title at first reads "the aristocrats." as the three kittens go by, toulouse notices the title, he removes the second r and pushes the letters together to form "the aristocats." see more &raquo; connections referenced in yes man&nbsp;(2008) see more &raquo; soundtracks charge fanfare (uncredited) traditional see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; sweet, romantic and completely underrated! 23 march 2007 | by elswet (.: fiendish writings in the dark :.) &ndash; see all my reviews this is not the masterpiece that is snow white, cinderella, or bambi, but it is a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done disney animated feature.there are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.while this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the classic disney romcom adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the aristocats. o&#39;malley is the &quot;tramp&quot; and dutchess is the &quot;lady,&quot; but dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.phil harris is our tomcat o&#39;malley. you may recognize his voice, as he also furnished the voice of baloo the bear in the jungle book, and little john in disney&#39;s robin hood. eva gabor lends her silky sweet voice to dutchess.directed by wolfgang reitherman, who directed, or worked on, every disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985.this is among my very favorite of the disney animated feature films, and belongs in any disney collection. the 2-disk special edition is due out this summer (2007).this rates an 8.4/10 from...the fiend :. 14 of 18 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
