trivia reunites sirs ian holm and robert stephens from bbc's radio drama 'lord of the rings' (1981). in that play, frodo baggins (holm) was a follower of lord aragorn (stephens); here the roles are reversed, with stephens playing auncient pistol, a low-ranking soldier under the command of holm's captain fluellen. see more &raquo; goofs after 4 minutes a violin string is plucked. this string is clearly one of the middle strings, either the &quot;d&quot; or the &quot;a&quot; string. however, we actually hear the sound of the &quot;e&quot; string being plucked. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] chorus: o! for a muse of fire, that would ascend; the brightest heaven of invention; a kingdom for a stage, princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene. then should the war-like harry, like himself, assume the port of mars; and at his heels, leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire crouch for employment. see more &raquo; connections referenced in sam and max hit the road&nbsp;(1993) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: is this film available on blu-ray disc?
