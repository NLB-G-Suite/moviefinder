edit storyline a stylish, freewheeling work set against the drug counterculture of the 1960's, high offers a surprisingly hard-edged look at the nastiness behind the sunny facade of the summer of love. tom, an amoral montreal drifter who supports himself by peddling dope and fleecing lonely woman, hooks up with vicky, a straight-laced librarian, and initiates her, all too well, into his criminal ways. the film is more experimental than kent's earlier features, with shifts from monochrome into color, liberal use of color tints, overexposures, and still photos, and a psychedelic credit sequences. replete with kent's characteristically frank sex scenes and nudity, high became a cause celebre when, just prior to its premier at the montreal film festival, it was banned by the quebec censors, prompting the likes of warren beatty, jean renoir and fritz lang to speak out in praise of the film. in a gesture of solidarity, alan king and jean-pierre lefebvre, co winners of the festival's canadian competition, ... written by g kaufman plot summary | add synopsis plot keywords: nudity | psychedelic | one word title | street hustler | streaking |&nbsp;see all (11)&nbsp;&raquo;

it's a good movie 2 april 2005 | by collwyn (canada) &ndash; see all my reviews i saw most this movie just last night on tv, and i thought it was great.as a 20something, i liked the 60s cinema black and white, the touch of colour at the end was interesting.perhaps the plot is weak as the other poster said, i didn't watch it from the start, but i found it really interesting and relaxing, and a totally different style of film than i'd seen.i felt the movie really got across the pot-smoked atmosphere it was trying to describe.it's not nearly as bad as the other review said, if you're interested in seeing an art porno from the 60s. 9 of 10 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
