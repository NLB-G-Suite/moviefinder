(i got used to the different style pretty fast, though, and it never bothered me again.)i can&#x27;t think of any other movie like it, in which a person tells his own story - nearly all of which is almost certainly true - playing himself but using a script and actors to play the other people in his life (there are a very few real people playing themselves, but even their lines are scripted).that&#x27;s the other problem for me: i never knew what to believe, what was true and what wasn&#x27;t. i&#x27;m not talking about the facts of his life, the playgirl stuff - as i said, that&#x27;s almost certainly all true. i mean his relationships, in particular his relationship with his boyfriend, called mike in the movie and played beautifully by michael marisi ornstein - the best actor in it, and no less charming and attractive than shafer is.is he real? those two guys are so amazing that i&#x27;d love to think they&#x27;re really a couple. so i loved the movie, but it left me a little unsettled, almost as if i&#x27;d watched a movie about my own life and left wondering how much of it was true. odd, but wonderful. 0 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 6 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: tammy shafer mike miller ken shafer angela lucassey kelly bound betty levy howie diadone ed, the photographer ballroom dancer woman exercising dr. marsha demarky pledge cartwright dee dee sweatman ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
