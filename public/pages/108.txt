it's up to one test subject's quick wit, sharp sense of humor, and utter intolerance for cinematic garbage to foil the plans of the scientist and to save the earth. written by anthony pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} plot summary | plot synopsis plot keywords: robot | scientist | based on cult tv series | outer space | cult film |&nbsp;see all (30)&nbsp;&raquo; taglines: finally a movie that's okay to talk through! see more&nbsp;&raquo; genres: comedy&nbsp;| horror&nbsp;| sci-fi motion picture rating (mpaa) rated pg-13 for some sexual humor | see all certifications&nbsp;&raquo; parents guide: view content advisory&nbsp;&raquo; edit details country: usa language: english release date: 21 june 1996 (brazil) see more&nbsp;&raquo; also known as: mst3k: the movie see more&nbsp;&raquo; filming locations: energy park studios - 1515 brewster street, st. paul, minnesota, usa see more&nbsp;&raquo; box office gross: $1,000,000 (usa) see more&nbsp;&raquo; company credits production co: best brains, universal pictures see more&nbsp;&raquo; show detailed company contact information on imdbpro&nbsp;&raquo; technical specs runtime: 73 min sound mix: dts color: color (eastmancolor) aspect ratio: 1.85 : 1 see full technical specs&nbsp;&raquo; edit did you know? trivia the makers of mystery science theater 3000 (1988) were so annoyed by their experiences having to work within a major studio on this film that they later parodied the experience on the tv series. in mystery science theater 3000: the incredible melting man (1996), the host segments are about crow's screenplay being purchased by a studio then ruined by the executives (dr. forrester and mother forrester) as they vainly try to shoot it and screen it for audiences. series writer and star mary jo pehl would later call the episode an "exercise in healing" after the ordeal of mst3k: the movie. see more &raquo; goofs mike folds the newspaper twice. see more &raquo; quotes crow t. robot: [as cal beats a mutant in the head] oh, i'm very vulnerable there! oh, there go the piano lessons! i can't remember my dad! see more &raquo; crazy credits when the re-recording company gets listed on the credits, mike speaks in a raspy-stuttering voice, "re-recorded at sync souuu-uunnnd-dd-dddddd!" see more &raquo; connections references i saw what you did&nbsp;(1965) see more &raquo; soundtracks love theme from mystery science theater 3000 music by charlie erickson and joel hodgson arranged and performed by dave alvin (as david alvin) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews excellent example of how studio interference severely tarnishes a brilliant idea 29 may 2004 | by tom (jkazoo@hotmail.com) (parts unknown) &ndash; see all my reviews let's get things straight right off the bat: i love mystery science theater 3000! it was, is, and forever will be my favorite television show of all time, in all its incarnations. and the movie is very funny and good and you should see it.that said...mystery science theater 3000: the movie (hereafter called mst3k:tm for time-saving purposes) could of been a lot better than it was, and it's not the fault of the folks at best brains, inc. (the production company that made the tv show, hereafter called bbi). i place the blame entirely on the fine (ha!) folks at universal, who forced several changes to the movie and it's wonderful riffing, forcing the folks at bbi to &quot;dumb down&quot; their product, mess with their tried-and-true break format, and shoot an entirely different (and stupid, compared to the original) ending, as well as trimming it down to 74 minutes (because at 88, it was too long! as servo would say &quot;...the hell?) when you come right down to it, bbi makes mst3k one way, and the studio told them to do it a different way. and any other way is the wrong way! i really wish that bbi had held out for an offer with more creative control, but if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, etc. i don't blame bbi for taking the offer, but the selfish part of me would of rather the film never got made than compromised so radically. then the realist in me tells me to be grateful that it did get made, and succeeds (somewhat) in spite of (and believe me, not because of) the restrictions placed on it. 4 stars to the fine folks at bbi, -1,000 stars to universal, 2 1/2 stars to the movie itself. it hurts me to say that about the movie, but it's true. 21 of 31 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 181 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
