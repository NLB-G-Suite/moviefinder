max: kgb? jodi kirkpatrick: the russian letter for z looks like a 3. so 33 means zz which means zapatnya zabov, which means "death to the west". they were based out of cuba to strike western targets. *they* being kgb away teams.

(but then even cindy's biggest detractors have never claimed she was pretentious.) while it is mainly for fans of the moled one, it's still short enough not to hurt, and it certainly improves on the last time the paula gosling novel it's based on was turned into a film (the truly awful &quot;cobra&quot; with sylvester stallone), and you don't often see films starring lawyer characters doing something other than criminal law. and before you point out that no lawyer ever looked as good as cindy crawford, remember that that never stopped steven bochco - or david e. kelley with &quot;ally mcbeal.&quot; now who would you rather be represented in court by, cindy or ally? 10 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 65 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: colonel ilya pavel kazak lieutenant meyerson emilio juantorena jodi kirkpatrick rita det. louis aragon zhukov rosa navigator baker graybera beanpole hacker ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
