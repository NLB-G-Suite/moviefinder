it&#x27;s a wonderful bishop&#x27;s life 12 march 2010 | by zunitrail-1 (japan) &ndash; see all my reviews i saw this when it was in the theaters. i basically loved it mainly for its music and jennifer lewis&#x27; (julia&#x27;s mother) performance, but also i loved the opening and closing (climax) scenes. i&#x27;m basically a sucker for that kind of thing, and i understand how other people wouldn&#x27;t find it interesting. i just saw the movie (the bishop&#x27;s wife) which it was based on and finally feel qualified to comment. tpw was not just a remake of tbw, but more of a combination of tbw and &#x22;it&#x27;s a wonderful life.&#x22; henry in tpw was the character of jimmy stewart in iwl, always caring for the underdog (altho very cynical to the angel&#x27;s angelhood); joe hamilton in tpw was &#x22;mr potter&#x22; of the same, with his schemes to redevelop and control the town. i actually found it charming the way elements of tbw found themselves woven into tpw: the ice skating scene, the typewriter-turned-pc, the final sermon, to name a few. but i did realize that the message had been diluted into a feel-good comedy. there are no moments where one feels deeply moved merely by dialogue, such as tbw&#x27;s dudley&#x27;s story of david and the lion, which captivates the bishop&#x27;s entire household, down to the all-business secretary (not to mention the audience!). in tpw, we are made to be moved by the beautiful music; and as such, i guess we might as well just buy the soundtrack. tbw reminded me that special effects are only as good as the movie itself. 7 of 9 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 48 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
