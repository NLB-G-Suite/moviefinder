see all my reviews i was really looking forward for this picture since i heard that michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange would star together. but when i eventually went to see it i must say i was a bit disappointed. i don't say that the movie was bad ,but the fact that i expected much more from it , make me regard it an average movie. the direction was very poor and the editing unacceptable. the adaption seemed to lack in many ways and jennifer jason leigh was unbearable. but seeing pfeiffer ang lange together on screen made me forget everything. these two great actresses proved for once more their talent. when you see them together on screen you forget all the disadvantages the movie has and there's nowhere else you want to be. they both deserved oscar nominations and lange probably the award too. jason robards though not as good as in some of his previous roles was great too. 5 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
