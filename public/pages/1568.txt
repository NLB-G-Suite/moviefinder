"mum" seems to think there is no harm in this, as long as joyce doesn't take part in the physical activities. harold gets caught up in a web of deceit and blackmail and each time he tries to break free of the grasp of "mum" she threatens to tell the police that he has been abusing joyce. the film continues much in this line, and it examines the effect of the relationship on both harold and joyce and how they are both driven to extreme action because of the influence of mrs. beasley. written by snc &lt;sile@physics.unimelb.edu.au&gt; plot summary | add synopsis plot keywords: fatal attraction | older woman younger man relationship | age difference | mother daughter relationship | infidelity |&nbsp;see all (16)&nbsp;&raquo; taglines: mum's the word. see more&nbsp;&raquo; genres: comedy&nbsp;| drama motion picture rating (mpaa) rated r for distrubing sexual situations, a scene of related violence and some language | see all certifications&nbsp;&raquo; parents guide: add content advisory for parents&nbsp;&raquo; edit details country: canada | uk language: english release date: 20 june 1997 (uk) see more&nbsp;&raquo; also known as: bed & breakfast - die miete zahlt der tod see more&nbsp;&raquo; filming locations: abergavenny, gwent, wales, uk see more&nbsp;&raquo; box office opening weekend: $12,918 (usa) (6 june 1997) gross: $7,100 (usa) (19 september 1997) see more&nbsp;&raquo; company credits production co: fox searchlight pictures, boxer films, handmade films see more&nbsp;&raquo; show detailed company contact information on imdbpro&nbsp;&raquo; technical specs color: color aspect ratio: 1.85 : 1 see full technical specs&nbsp;&raquo; edit did you know?

not for this director the typically adolescent romanticism that so admires the supreme perversity of self-immolation. it is not that he condemns his characters for their weakness, or even that he harps particularly upon their evil natures, for he does neither, choosing instead to regret the selfishness, the solipsism, that has excluded them from the human family. much as mankind in general is excluded from the innocence of its early, edenic, dreams by the psychological burden of a self-consciousness that actually is the guilty sense of being regarded as having drawn attention to the self: the whole psychological evolution of modern man seems to demand that we must constantly seek to submerge our sense of the obtruding and distracting self to our sense of the other. whereas, in 'mum''s household rebellious emotions finally overwhelm all pretence of domesticity, and the world beyond their walls, for them, ceases to be of any relevance or significance, and therefore becomes absolutely untenable and unsustainable. there is no 'consequence-free' zone where they may be permitted to go off and begin new lives, in any conceivably more sympathetic milieu: as much as in arthur penn's film of 'bonnie &amp; clyde' these are lives driven to their own destruction by their own interior demons. they are by no means the exemplary free spirits that some might wish them to represent. quite the opposite - they are the damned. they are a lesson, and a warning. it is possibly for just such conceptual offence against the reckless modern creed of untrammeled and indulged individualism that this film has been punished at the box-office, upon its release. it is made a more important film thereby, and will stand the test of time, that destroys the transient glamour of fashion. all the acting is very fine, but julie walters gives a phenomenal performance. altogether a great piece of work. 1 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
