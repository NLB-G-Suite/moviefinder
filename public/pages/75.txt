see all my reviews great movie..and i can see why it is underrated...possibly due to obvious comparisons to scarface (brian de palma, martin bregman, al pacino team), which was much more brutal in its approach.al pacino as carlito, awesome as he is, is still much softer compared to the sledgehammer tony montana. and then there is some romance mixed in with the story of a gangster trying to reform himself.i didn't like the romantic scenes myself...thought they interrupted the flow of the story...hence i gave it a 9 instead of a 10! there is also some clich&eacute;d dialogue. i happen to be a big pacino fan and so i am being a little bit (though not entirely) biased and am sidelining all these things. if you excuse these small potatoes, this one is a great flick from start to finish, very entertaining, with some fantastic performances from the supporting cast, e.g. sean penn. special mention, also, of viggo mortensen who comes in for a short role, but plays the part wonderfully.as for al pacino in lead role, he makes sure he steals the show, as usual. brilliant! 67 of 77 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
