see all my reviews this is a movie i think you could say is in the same category as the classic pulp fiction. where can you see a guy going around killing people in cold blood seemingly without any reason, if not in these two films. i really liked the way jason priestley plays his character, from a innocent, retarded kid to a cold-blooded assassin. i must say it seemed as a b-movie in the beginning, but as the movie went on, it only got better and better. something else that was fun is michael j. fox's appearance in the movie. great scene. a must see! 9 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
