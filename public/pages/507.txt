see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; 744 people need to rethink their ratings 1 august 2005 | by earlgreyboy (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews the fact that 744 people on the internet movie database gave lawrence of arabia a &quot;1&quot; one the the 1-10 scale is outright obscene. not only is lawrence of arabia one of the best cinematic achievements of all time, and historically intriguing to boot, it's a just plain great film with a little bit of something for everyone, including a rich historical plot, vibrant characters, great setting, and plenty of fabulously choreographed battle scenes. the film is also topical for today's society, for example: &quot;why is terrorism so popular in the middle east today? well, it might just have something to do with the fact t.e. lawrence encouraged the arab tribes to deal with their ottoman occupiers using bombs and machine guns.&quot; how anyone with eyes and ears could dislike this movie that much is beyond my comprehension. 141 of 191 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
