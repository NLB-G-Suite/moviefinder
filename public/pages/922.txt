feeling that romantic comedies leave you with. it doesn't have all the violence that you see in today's movies on television but yet it hints at the cautions of the violence that kids need to be wary of so that it makes you think about it in terms of being cautious. it also hints at a little puppy-love with the thirteen year old kids. the phrases that they use are current so it makes the movie believable in today's times. it is just the right length and also ends very nicely. it's a great all-around movie that everyone can enjoy watching over and over again. i'd see it again and again because i liked it so much. 4 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
