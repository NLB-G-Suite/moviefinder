edit did you know? trivia walter hill felt the title of the film should have been the geronimo war. "the conception was you make the film from the last time he came in and broke off and was sent away," he said. "the last time he broke off the reservations. this had been a recurring pattern. i thought that would be more accurate." see more &raquo; goofs when confronted in the mexican cantina, schoonover states that he is from brewster county, tx. brewster did not exist until it was marked off from presidio county in february 1887, whereas this scene is set prior to geronimo's surrender in september 1886. see more &raquo; quotes brig. gen. george crook: a lot of white-eyes want to see geronimo hanged for murder. geronimo: not murder. war. many bad things happen in war. brig. gen. george crook: how many white-eye did you kill since you left turkey creek? geronimo: maybe fifty. maybe more. how many apaches do you kill? brig. gen. george crook: you killed women and children. geronimo: so did you. see more &raquo; connections referenced in leprechaun 2&nbsp;(1994) see more &raquo; soundtracks deal gently with thy servants, lord performed by the boston camerata, schola cantorum (as the schola cantorum of boston) joel cohen, director; frederick jodry, director courtesy of erato disques s.a. by arrangement with warner special products see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; no heroes on both sides 23 august 2002 | by michael (mime.de@t-online.de) (stein, germany) &ndash; see all my reviews this underrated western (in germany hills picture disappears after one week from the cinema) convinces with an excellent script (i realize again, john milius is much better in writing as directing), a stunning photography and outstanding performances of the lead characters. studi is great, a wonderful study of pride and his understanding that he never can win his war against white men. especially this poetic and realistic movie is by comparison with other indian sagas not a fairy tale from far west. hill tells the truth and so we see only desperate people and no heroes - on both sides. great - a must see for fans. i give 8 out of 10 stars. 16 of 17 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 51 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: lt. charles gatewood lt. britton davis mangas sgt. turkey sgt. dutchy capt. hentig city marshal joe hawkins old nana ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
