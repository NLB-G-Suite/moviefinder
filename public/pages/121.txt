user reviews carrey's greatest! 30 june 2001 | by infofreako (perth, australia) &ndash; see all my reviews i divide movie fans into two types - those that love the cable guy, and those that don't. the latter i try and avoid. welcome to the most misunderstood, unjustly dissed movie of the 90s! even homer simpson hates it! i'm not going waste time trying to change anybody's mind on this gem. if you don't see the sheer brilliance of this you're beyond hope. all i can say is that it rocks in every way. jim carrey has never been better as the creepy, psycho stalker &quot;chip douglas&quot;, and matthew broderick is wonderfully likeable as chip's unsuspecting customer. add to that a tremendously cool supporting cast of cult legends including charles napier, janeane garofolo, eric roberts, mr. show's bob and david, sean whalen,owen wilson, andy dick and both members of tenacious d, among others.full of memorable sequences - the karaoke jam, the medieval theme restaurant, director ben stiller's recurring duel role - the cable guy is smart-as-a-whip, black, surreal, funny, funny stuff! 78 of 102 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
