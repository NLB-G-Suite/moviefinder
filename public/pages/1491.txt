user reviews &nbsp; deep and wonderful 31 december 2004 | by waynepenner &ndash; see all my reviews this beautiful love story contrasts corruption with goodness.harrison ford underplays his role so well it is scandalous &#150; his hollywood buddies must have laughed their arses off at him taking this role&#133; what some cop living with amish? sounds lame right, until all the oscar nom's start pouring in &#133; but he is nothing short of brilliant as detective john book. i love the scene when he gets that old car-radio working, that old heap of junk in a barn that opens up his love with rachel, and she dances and sings for the first time in her life.it is beautifully written, the screenplay is flawless, the editing is flawless. the pacing is flawless but won't appeal to those who want car-chases and guns going off all over the place, and a beer and a hot-dog for dinner ... uh you know who i mean &#133;this film gives a gentle insight into the simple sweetness of amish life. us &quot;sophisticates&quot; with our frequent-flyers and cell phones and ipods and laptops and instant everything &#133; we all may be missing something they already found&#133; a wonderfully inspirational and deeply satisfying film. 48 of 62 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
