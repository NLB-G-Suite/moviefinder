user reviews &nbsp; my favorite film 14 october 2005 | by rmgirl1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this is the best movie ever, but that is my opinion. some say it's cheesy but i think it is truly a beautiful film. the chemistry between jennifer grey and patrick swayze it's like no other i have ever seen, and that is what makes the film so perfect. i always wonder what would have been of this film if these two actors never existed, because not just one them did it for me, they both did. if you have never seen this film, when you do you will understand what i mean. dirty dancing looks like it was done from the heart and it feels so real for some reason, like magic- and the soundtrack love it. besides the 2 lead actors the soundtrack makes the film the beauty that it is. as you can tell i am in love with this film, and i know you will be too. 56 of 95 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
