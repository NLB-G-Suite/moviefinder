directed by peter segal (the nutty professor 2:the klumps, anger management, tommy boy) made an entertaining spoof comedy, based on the short-lived tv series back in the early 1980&#39;s. nielsen is always an hoot in the lead. the cast seems to be having an great time. although the reviews were mixed and at the box office was less promising than the first two but still, this was an major success on video. there&#39;s some lively cameos throughout the feature. if you are fan of these type of silly comedies or &quot;the naked gun&quot; movies, you will certainly enjoy it. written by pat proft (the naked gun:from the files of police squad!, hot shots! part deux, scary movie 3 &amp; 4), david zucker (an american carol, high school high, top secret!) and robert locash (cb4).
