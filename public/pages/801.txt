quotes web smith: [after pushing on wall to find a hidden room] the executive fuck chamber. see more &raquo; crazy credits there is a credit in rising sun thanking "the mit leg lab" and "marc raibert and his running team." this refers to a short scene where the two detectives go out to a fancy-looking research lab (really a water treatment plant; also used as the set for starfleet academy on the tv series "star trek - the next generation). in the background of some of the shots there are two legged robots: one hopping in a circle in a tea-house; the other bouncing up a garden path. these robots are actually academic research projects from the mit ai lab's legged locomotion lab. they really do hop about and maintain their balance. power comes from off-board hydraulic pumps (hence the guy in the background (me!) pulling hoses for the robot), and body attitude is sensed with gyroscopes. a human with a joystick tells the robot what direction to go, and the control algorithms (which are the real subject of leg lab research) maintain speed, direction, and balance. however, the robots aren't designed for special effects. they're always being modified, and they tend to break down frequently. this made shooting in the hot july sun of the san fernando valley a real nightmare, with transputers crashing in the heat, stuck gyros, and hydraulic leaks. three grad students and a professor worked steadily for about a month before hollywood, and then five days on the set and on location to get the robots in about 15 seconds of film. the credits are: marc raibert (our prof), and charles francois, rob playter and lee campbell (me) who are students. we three students appear in the film in white lab coats acting like robot scientists!! see more &raquo;

see all my reviews the background of the film is the american-japonese business competition in l.a. where a cop (wesley snipes) accused by corruption teams up with old man (sean connery) , expert on japanese world . they&#x27;re investigating a killing case filmed in videotape recording and located at an important corporation run by powerful manager (mako)and it implicates a senator (ray wise) . the homicide is committed on a boardroom table while a beautiful prostitute is strangled when having sex with her lover , being prime suspect a japanese executive (gary -hiroyuki tagawa). the identity of the murderer is taken by a security camera on a missing disk . meantime , another tough police( harvey keitel) is also investigating and they&#x27;re helped by a gorgeous video expert (tia carrere). soon discover on the final breaking point that even the truth can lie .the tale mingles suspense , thriller , mystery , quick action , buddy movie and is quite entertaining . however , the complicated script contains some flaws and gaps , originating fails on credibility but gets its nice moments here and there . based on controversial novel by michael crichton , it is adapted by philip kaufman and crichton, blending business, japanese customs, high technology and international politics, turning out some confusing and silly . for that reason, the screenplay was rewritten several times, focusing more the killing suspense and relying heavily on relationship between two leads and the differences us-japan . michael crichton, author of the book and co-author of the screenplay, wrote the part of connor with sean connery in mind. writers michael crichton and michael backes quit the project largely over disagreement with director philip kaufman that one of the lead characters should be changed into an african-american . evocative japanese music score by takemitsu (kurosawa&#x27;s usual musician) and appropriate cinematography with stylized camera techniques by michael chapman . this one gets acceptable direction by philip kaufman (quills, right stuff, body snatchers) . the film will appeal to wesley snipes and sean connery fans. 12 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
