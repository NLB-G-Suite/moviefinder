trivia the cast included 84 boys between 8 and 15 years of age, and one member of parliament suggested they were being exploited just as the depicted orphans had been. the filmmakers replied that they needed protection more than the boys did, due to the rowdy nature of the production during the summer. see more &raquo; goofs while singing &quot;as long as he needs me,&quot; nancy's dress hangs off her shoulder and then in the next shot it is back on her shoulder. see more &raquo; quotes fagin: [fagin and the boys are abandoning their hideout as the mob closes in. however, bill sikes is determined to escape at all costs using oliver as a hostage] bill! why make things worse?
