see all my reviews steven seagal might not be arnold schwarzenneger or bruce willis, but under siege quickly became one of 1992's most successful films, earning seagal a fine reputation as a good action star. andrew davis directed the film about a us battleship that has been taken over by tommy lee jones and gary busey and it's up to steven seagal, whom acts as a chef cook, but is really an ex-navy seal to save the day with the help of the ever sexy erika eleniak playing miss july 1989. jones and busey particularly are great as the two villians and the action scenes and karate moves from seagal are quite well choregraphed with a fine score by gary chang. the supportive cast, topped off by patrick adams, colm mehoney, nick mancuso, andy romano, troy evans, glenn morshower, dennis lipscomb and damian chapa all turn in fine and impressive even humerous performances. highly recommended for fans of the action genre. 27 of 35 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
