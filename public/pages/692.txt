see all my reviews i would disagree with the previous user comment. miami rhapsody was both funny and intelligent. indeed it saunters along with the rhythm of a woody allen flick but this is simply because it captures characters in dialouge rarely heard in most hollywood films. furthermore...it was truly refreshing to get to see sarah jessica parker in a role (pre-sex in the city) that really uses her talents as both as comedian and dramatist. it was super refreshing to see a neurotic thinking womens role that toyed with the notion of marriage and commitment. we may think it is overdone now with the re-runs of sex in the city and all...but put yourself back in 1995. so yeah...i liked it. 6 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
