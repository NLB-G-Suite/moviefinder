(london, england) &ndash; see all my reviews i've seen 'unzipped' many, many times and every time i see it feels as refreshing as it felt the first time. mizrahi is very interesting, funny and talented at the same time and this film really provides insight into this man's life and career.what i like about 'unzipped' is that it doesn't show everything. it sifts the recorded events to show something entertaining, with the reality factor still there. i also understand that some scenes like the intro or the ending are probably not &quot;real&quot;, but i don't care.'unzipped' is more a movie and less a documentary and i love it. and it's got sandra bernhard in it; what more do you want?9/10 3 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 15 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
