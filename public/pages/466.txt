trivia the line quoted by doc at the end of the fight at the ok corral is historically true, and was reported in the tombstone papers reporting the fight. when confronted by one of the cowboys at point blank range, the cowboy reportedly said, "i got you now doc, you son of a bitch!", to which doc gleefully retorted, "you're a daisy if you do!" see more &raquo; goofs a few scenes prior to the ok corral shootout, members of the cowboys gang are seen riding towards town as the sun is low in the sky. in the next scene, as they slowly ride past the earps who are in front of the sheriff's office, from the cowboys' perspective the sun's light shines on the earps from the horizon. when the camera switches to the earps' perspective, however, the sun's light is shining directly down on the cowboys from overhead. the camera switches back to the cowboys' perspective and then the earps' one more time, and in each case the sun is in different positions in the sky. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] narrator: 1879 - the civil war is over, and the resulting economic explosion spurs the great migration west. farmers, ranchers, prospectors, killers, and thieves seek their fortune. cattle growers turn cow towns into armed camps, with murder rates higher than than those of modern day new york or los angeles. out of this chaos comes legendary lawman wyatt earp, retiring his badge and gun to start a peaceful life for his family. earp's friend, john, doc holliday, a southern gentlemen turned ... see more &raquo; crazy credits for birgitta c. see more &raquo; connections referenced in slew hampshire&nbsp;(2013) see more &raquo; soundtracks le danse macabre by camille saint-saëns (accompanying music in the theatre sequence) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what is doc's illness?
