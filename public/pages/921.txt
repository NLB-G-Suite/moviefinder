trivia in addition to marlon brando as doctor moreau, richard stanley wanted bruce willis to play edward and james woods to play montgomery. willis dropped out due to his divorce from demi moore and woods was replaced by val kilmer, whom it was believed would be a bigger draw. see more &raquo; goofs when dr. moreau prepares to inject a drug into one of the &quot;humanimals&quot;, the needle of the syringe is visible. after that visual switches away then back to dr. moreau, the needle is no longer there. it reappears right after while dr. moreau is injecting the creature. see more &raquo; quotes sayer of the law: it is a hard way, the way of being a man. sooner or later we all want a thing that is bad. to walk on all fours. to suck up drink from a stream. to jabber, instead of saying the words. to go snuffling at the earth, and to claw on the bark of trees. to eat flesh, or fish. to make love to more than one, every which way. these are all bad things. these are not the things that men do. but we are men, are we not?

see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; well-produced but out of control 15 april 2006 | by moonspinner55 (las vegas, nv) &ndash; see all my reviews david thewlis is very good as air-crash survivor who is taken to mysterious island in the south pacific where recluse marlon brando mutates various animals with human genes; fairuza balk is brando&#39;s daughter, val kilmer (in arguably his weakest performance ever) plays brando&#39;s assistant. uncontrolled version of h.g. wells&#39; horror story is crippled by behind-the-scenes strife and ego clashes. it opens well, sustains itself for about forty-five minutes, but then goes completely to hell afterward. john frankenheimer is credited with the scrappy direction, though he stepped in mid-production and finished the picture after kilmer had the original director canned. too bad, with more focus this could&#39;ve been incredible. story previously filmed in 1933 (as &quot;island of lost souls&quot;) and with michael york and burt lancaster in 1977. ** from **** 31 of 46 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
