see all my reviews there are very good, specific comments on this film already, so i will limit mine to general, nearly abstract remarks.while some of the technology used in the film may become obsolete, the main theme is timeless. the paradox is this: as humans get more and more connected by phones, faxes, internet, and so on, they become more and more disconnected from each other. virtual contact replaces physical contact. we are not the better for it. for raising a timeless question this movie will become a minor classic. the film has a great sense of humor. it may appeal to east coasters, to europeans, to fans of woody allen, and to lovers of independent new york comedies. main target audience: you with the phone in the hand. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
