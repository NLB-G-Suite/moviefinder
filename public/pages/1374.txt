a beautiful, romantic movie 9 april 2005 | by friend_city (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie is really tender, touching, and warm. the 2 lead actresses were very good and had good chemistry in between them. these 2 have complete opposite personalities with different passions for lives. yet somehow, they come across with one another and fall in love with each other. camille fought with her own inner feelings for petra and finally, she went for who she really loved. the ending is very sweet, the true love staying with each other. sometimes it is difficult to figure out what you really want but what is more importantly how you embrace it despite all difficulties in life. camille had to go thru emotional battles with her feelings for her boyfriend and the christian school job. the circus performances scenes were great and interesting. the lovemaking scene between them is very passionate and romantic. these 2 actresses were excellent. the dialogs are interesting. the director has done an outstanding job with both directing and writing. overall, it is a great movie to watch and keep for collection. highly recommended. 18 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
