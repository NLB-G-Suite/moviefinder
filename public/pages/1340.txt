did anyone of you understand it? 3 march 1999 | by walrus-5 (porto alegre, brasil) &ndash; see all my reviews this is a very strange film, indeed. in the plot there's something about a latvian immigrant in paris, a couple of homosexuals, an old lady's murderer, some african immigrants (i think they're from the maurice islands), a woman who is a hotel manager and protects the young latvian, a transvestite who has his own show on a nightclub, and some other crimes and weird stuff.but it's not a bad movie after all. despite the confusing plot, the film has some very nice sequences, some shocking scenes and one of the most beautiful actresses i've ever seen, ms. katherina golubeva, whom i'd never heard about before this film. if you have a lot of time to spend, and you're in the mood for an unusual motion picture with a gorgeous young actress, &quot;j'ai pas sommeil&quot; is a good pick. 4 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 13 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo;
