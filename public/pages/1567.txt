kiefer sutherland's directorial debut is quite self-assured. kevin pollak's character as a hostage who is strangely drawn to the lifestyle of his captors is terrific despite his formulaic &quot;coming-around&quot; at the end. mykelti williamson and grace phillips as pollak's girlfriend are both revelations. vincent gallo is an unusual actor and definitely an acquired taste, but he works well here with kim dickens as his bonnie. in all, a film you'll be pleasantly surprised with as a bargain rental. 5 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
