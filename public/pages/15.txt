see all my reviews this film is typical of films made outside of mainstream hollywood studios; it takes some old themes and treats them with an attention-grabbing freshness. playing loli, a young housewife living in the south of france, victoria abril is as delightful as a spring breeze in provence. her husband is an incorrigible infidel; we've seen many of those in films. however, when the masculine marijo, played poignantly by josiane balasko, enters their lives, the story takes many unexpected and entertaining turns which render a fairly common theme completely unpredictable. everyone to whom i recommend this film ends up watching it numerous times and recommending it to others. the soundtrack is now one of my most-played cd's. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
