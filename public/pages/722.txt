see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; an artful french epic of wickedness, intrigue, and treachery. 7 april 2001 | by george parker (orange county, ca usa) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;queen margot&quot; is a french epic drama which tells of the political forces at work in france at the time of the st. bartholomew's day massacre which signaled the beginning of the end of the &quot;religious wars&quot; raging in france in the early to mid 16th century. queen margot (adjani) is at the center of this maelstrom of wickedness and treachery which looks at everything from poison lip rouge to a bloody holocaust. an elaborate award winning production, &quot;queen margot&quot; presents its history realistically with no clear sense of good or evil - unlike &quot;braveheart&quot;, for example - with countless extras, spectacular costuming, and artistry in cinematography. well worth its 2.5 hour run, this dark film, based on the novel by a. dumas, is lacking in the didactic and will be difficult to follow for all but those with historical knowledge of the place and time. a little research prior to watching the film can go a long way toward understanding the complexities of the story. 24 of 37 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
