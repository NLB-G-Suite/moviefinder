user reviews &nbsp; gruesome, violent, amazing 14 october 2000 | by madmanmarz (bklyn ny) &ndash; see all my reviews one of the most gruesome slasher films, i remember from the 80's that played in theaters was nightmare. a nicely woven little tale of a dangerous individual released from a mental ward under the impression that he is cured. the nightmare of the title is that of george tatum's mind. one of the violent murder of a man and a woman having a session of s&amp;m by a young boy. this nightmare is slowly revealed in the film untill we finally witness this sequence which just happens to be one of the most gruesome and powerful murder scenes in cinematic history(in my opinion). the scene really has to be seen to be appreciated, totally mind shattering. not all of this film is great though. very slow at parts and a couple of horrible supporting parts weigh the film down a bit. still the lead role of george tatum(brian stfford) is excellently portrayed, the highlight murder sequence is slowly disclosed and repeated quite effectively, and overall nightmare is memorable and really delivers the gore(if you like that kind of stuff) and will possibly scar your mind!!! 9 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
