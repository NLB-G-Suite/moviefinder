he's a naturalist who's addicted to nature; a humanist who's dedicated to the intimate. (the mother and son in his film are not characters or types or ciphers or &quot;performances.&quot;) the camera movements are so beautifully slow that they're hard to describe -- imagine the precision of &quot;ordet&quot; had it been made in color, those images still and hazy, like pastoral paintings with glowing hues of light. they're some of the purest images i've ever seen, comparable to &quot;barry lyndon&quot; and &quot;mccabe &amp; mrs. miller.&quot; what is so startling is that the color makes the film seem modern -- and such a hazy yet lucid color, maddin-like in its expressionism and schemes: fable-like and emotionally incestuous. it exists outside time, its only indicator a train within the film; existential emptiness represented visually. the film passes by quickly, with the perpetual wind that sounds like the ocean. it's as if the film is a progression of the most beautiful visions imaginable, the various images of death.it is something different -- art should be unique, if we're talking about art in the vein of picasso, shakespeare, and bach, shouldn't it be an experience like no other? in fact, this could easily be compared to tarkovsky, the most obvious comparison. but for me it feels more like dreyer without the self-conscious dialogue. it couldn't be said to be complex -- it's two characters talking rather simply. but what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in singularity. (the images are at times so rich that it's almost comical -- is this a film set or not?) it's the kind of film that's easy to make fun of, intruding on the most personal moments of this pathetic-looking mother and her son who constantly speaks in a hushed tone -- you imagine one of those &quot;seinfeld&quot; village voice parodies. it isn't emotional or intellectual; i don't even know if it's profound. but it's a masterpiece, plain and simple. 10/10 16 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 34 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: son mother ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
