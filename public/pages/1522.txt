crazy credits in the opening credits, we are correctly informed that the film is based on the novel "pop. 1280"; but during the end titles, we are informed that it is based on "pop. 1275". this is consistent with the official title retained for the translation into french, which is "1275 ames" (literally: "1275 souls"), and which reflects the fact that 5 people have died during the course of action. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews bertrand tavernier once again shows why he&#x27;s one of his country&#x27;s most challenging directors with this disturbing dark comedy, loosely adapted from a jim thompson novel (&#x27;pop 1280&#x27;) but relocated to french equatorial africa just before world war ii. the story follows a lazy, ineffective police chief in a dusty colonial city, who begins to manipulate his tormentors in much the same way they earlier abused him, discovering along the way the omnipotence of his position and the immunity provided by his reputation as an incompetent buffoon. after suffering the indignities of a natural born doormat all his life, he strikes back with a vengeance, slowly descending into a rational madness that commands sympathy while simultaneously provoking moral outrage (at one point he callously murders the innocent native servant who mistakenly witnessed on of his killings). tavernier builds the tension from his characters rather than from the plot, using touches of unsettling black humor to further blur the line dividing comedy and tragedy. 8 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
