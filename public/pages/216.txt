trivia the 2006 infinifilm release fixes a continuity error in the original film. in the scene where glen watches over nancy as she sleeps, she turns her light off before sleeping, but it's on when she wakes up. the infinifilm release fixes this mistake, by digitally darkening the room when she wakes up, until nancy's mother enters the room and turns it on. see more &raquo; goofs (at around 16 mins) while freddy scrapes his claws while his arms are elongated, while chasing nancy down the lane, you can clearly see the skin under his glove is normal. anyone who was burned to death would be scarred from head to toe. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] fred krueger: tina. see more &raquo; connections featured in super secret movie rules: slashers&nbsp;(2004) see more &raquo; soundtracks nightmare performed by 213 written and produced by martin kent, steve karshner, michael schurig see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: where is the film set?
