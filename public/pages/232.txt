outstanding entertainment; burton&#39;s most underrated film 29 november 2006 | by ccthemovieman-1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews what a wild movie! i&#39;ve begun to appreciate this more and more with multiple viewings. i think it&#39;s tim burton&#39;s most underrated film. unlike many of his previous films, this seems pretty impartial when it comes to the satire: everyone gets it here, not just the usual christians. here, new ange devotees and liberal advisers and generals are also made to look stupid. this is probably one reason the national critics - who are overwhelming left wing - didn&#39;t like this movie. they weren&#39;t used to the same abuse some of us put up with all the time.politics aside, this is one funny movie. it&#39;s a combination of science fiction, drama and comedy. it&#39;s a parody of the 1950s flying saucer films except it has 1990s color and good special-effects. burton was a fan of those corny &#39;50s sci-fi films so he made his own!the story quickly moves from one character to another, from the low-key president of the u.s. played by an unusually-reserved jack nicholson to the wacky new ager annette benning to martin short with his goofy smile....well, there are so many characters here - most of them completely whacked - it&#39;s too many to mention. the diversity of these people and the subtle humor in which they are all presented is just as much fun to watch as the special-effects. the martians are a real hoot. they have to be seen to be believed.i didn&#39;t like all the characters but, most people won&#39;t either. for me, showing elderly people as senile (sylvia sidney&#39;s role) is mean-spirited; rod steiger has the stereotypical war-mongering general is getting tiresome and the obvious politically-correct role for jim brown also went overboard. all in all, however, this is about as entertaining a film as i have ever found, nd one that gets more enjoyable with each viewing.....which is why i rate it so high. 70 of 96 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
