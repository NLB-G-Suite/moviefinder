see all my reviews this is a very very intelligent movie. from a historical point of view, it's perfect! it shows how cruel and vain the french noblesse was before the french revolution of 1789, and why this country had a revolution! it's also a fantastic movie for the beauty of the french language. actors are fabulous, with berling, rochefort and ardant. for me, french cinema is always at it's peak when they're doing comedy of historical movies, like this one, or beaumarchais l'insolent, marquise, or cyrano de bergerac. by the way, i'd like to tell thefan-2 of detroit that the ridicule of the title don't mean ridiculous. in the renaissance french language, it means hard. and that's what is facing berling, when he wants to get in touch the king to help the poor people of his land. 10 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
