an awesome romantic fairy tale! 16 october 2002 | by hereiam35 (north carolina) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie is meant to be a bit of fluff, not to be taken too seriously. but it more than adequately describes the emotions and crazy things done in the name of love. no, it won't win an academy award, but it wasn't meant to. if you want a great piece of entertainment that is perfect for a nice quiet date, that is sure to bring a smile to your face and a great feeling to your heart, i strongly recommend this movie! 3 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
