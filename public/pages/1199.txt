frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; aren't assassinations thrilling? 7 february 2002 | by carly (xvpanterax@aol.com) (chicago) &ndash; see all my reviews ok fellahs and dames, i saw this movie for the first time...yesterday...6 years this movie has been out and i saw it yesterday, pathetic i know, but i was definately not disappointed. not only does this movie possess comedy, but it's thrilling. i was on the edge of my seat in some of the scenes. i honestly didn't know who to cheer for between miguel (antonio banderas) and robert (sylvester stallone). i enjoy them both and both their characters were hitmen. even though robert was trying to go through a change, he was still a hitman, end of story. now miguel he was a little more cut-throat. in this story robert is starting to grow a soft spot and only kills the person he was hired to kill...leaving innocents out of it. while miguel was ready to shoot a 7-year old soccer player to get what he wanted. banderas plays this part well. i dunno if any of you caught this but when banderas is handling a gun he does alot of the same things in movie. scenes from the movie &quot;desperado&quot; started to flash in my head when i saw banderas and stallone duking it out at the cemetary. robert is then hired to hit a mark, which is a woman who is only known by a pair of cat eyes, to retrieve a disc, and also kill the buyers. miguel is also hired for the same job causing a little game between the 2 hitmen. ofcourse robert can't come around to killing electra (julianne moore), so he instead protects her and later teams up with her for some more delightfully planned out &quot;fun&quot;. i really enjoyed this movie because i am the crime loving type. i also loved it because of the connection between electra and robert. a definate must see if you enjoy movies such as this. if you don't prefer them then go watch, &quot;aladdin&quot;. 16 of 22 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
