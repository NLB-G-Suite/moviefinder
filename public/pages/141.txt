frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews in my personal top-ten of all time 8 december 1998 | by dweck (philadelphia, pa, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews has julie andrews ever appeared on film more beautifully than in this film? has she ever sung with such richness and gusto as is captured here? as a big fan of hers, i can watch this musical over and over and just sigh.wise and his cinematographer have photographed andrews in a manner that no other director has--even her husband. watch the scene where maria watches the captain sing edelweiss with the kids. wise turns her into a gauzy angel. it is a fantastic moment among hundreds that this movie contains.i am firmly in a camp that says julie andrews was completely, utterly, and regrettably robbed when the 1965 oscars were handed out. she embodied maria von trapp, wholly and with every fiber of her being (just watch the scene in which she races the boys in a segment of &quot;do-re-mi&quot;; she runs at the camera with utter abandon here, no holding back. or consider the shot at the end of this song, where she places her hand atop her head--it's as if even she can't believe she's hitting that note).the julie christie performance that beat andrews is now all but forgotton. &quot;the sound of music,&quot; however, lives on and on.&quot;the sound of music&quot; is a bit bittersweet for me, given that audiences tastes would soon turn away from big-budget musicals in general and julie andrews specifically. but what a legacy it (and she) have left! 97 of 150 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
