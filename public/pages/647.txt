user reviews &nbsp; inspiration 8 march 2000 | by jason (lillyja@mail.wvsc.edu) (west virginia, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews as a lover of stephen king's writing style and rob reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. it is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. and i will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, &quot;the body&quot; has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.first of all, i enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. &quot;stand by me&quot; fits what the characters in the story are facing. i think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to. all of us know someone like these characters. most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a &quot;bad kid.&quot; and the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. the fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.to me, gordy represents all of us. i found myself seeing a little of me in gordy as i watched the film. i don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, gordy still stood up for what he believed in. and, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.this film is certainly one of my top favorites. in fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. i feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. few films are able to do that and i think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future. 118 of 136 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
