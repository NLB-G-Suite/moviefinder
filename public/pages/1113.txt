edit storyline a documentary crew from the bbc arrives in l.a. intent on interviewing heidi fleiss, a year after her arrest for running a brothel but before her trial. several months elapse before the interview, so the crew searches for anyone who'll talk about the young woman. two people have a lot to say to the camera: a retired madam named alex for whom fleiss once worked and fleiss's one-time boyfriend, ivan nagy, who introduced her to alex. alex and nagy don't like each other, so the crew shuttles between them with "she said" and "he said." when they finally interview fleiss, they spend their time reciting what alex and nagy have had to say and asking her reaction. written by &lt;jhailey@hotmail.com&gt;

a labyrinthine world 19 april 2007 | by wavecat13 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews those who take a look at this hoping for a wild romp thru a world of sex, drugs, big money, celebrities, and california sun-baked sleaze are in for a little surprise. yes, there is some of that, but mostly this is a mind-boggling tale of screwy relationships and endless back-stabbing. heidi fleiss, the daughter of a liberal doctor and a prostitute turned madame, is at the center of this story. her prosecution made headlines in the early 1990s, and this movie attempts to understand her and her labyrinthine relationships with sleazy charmers like elderly madame alex and second-rate producer-director ivan nagy. broomfield and his crew do a good job of trying to come to grips with this odd, and very l.a., cast of characters, many of whom seem unable to not perform when a camera is turned on them. interesting secondary characters pop up, like a shadowy underworld character named cookie; l.a. police chief darryl gates, who accepts a nice cash sum before his interview; crooked top detective mike b. (can&#39;t think of his name right now); and porn stars ron jeremy and tisa. at the end, it is still not clear who has done what to whom and why, but you do have some insight into the dark side of the sunny southland. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 12 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: narrator innocent actress actor ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
