edit storyline the film deals with the situation of british prisoners of war during world war ii who are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the burma-siam railway. their instinct is to sabotage the bridge but, under the leadership of colonel nicholson, they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of british morale, spirit and dignity in adverse circumstances. at first, the prisoners admire nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of the japanese commandant saito. he is an honorable but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded obsessive. he convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to british character, but actually is a monument to himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy. unknown to him, the allies have sent a mission into the jungle, led by warden and an american, shears, to blow up the bridge. written by alfiehitchie plot summary | plot synopsis plot keywords: bridge | jungle | allies | construction | sabotage |&nbsp;see all (93)&nbsp;&raquo;

edit did you know? trivia producer sam spiegel brought david lean and carl foreman together for a brief period of time to work on the screenplay. the tension between lean and foreman was apparent, much to spiegel's delight. spiegel felt that the best screenplays were born out of friction and discord. in this case, tensions became too great and foreman left the project. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews about as oscar-worthy as any film made in the '50s is david lean's gripping bridge on the river kwai. based loosely on a real-life incident, it tells the story of an imprisoned british officer (alec guinness) who loses sight of his mission when forced to build a bridge for the japanese that will enable the enemy to carry supplies by train through the jungle during world war ii. guinness plays the crisp british officer to perfection, brilliant in all of his scenes but especially in his confrontations with sessue hayakawa. william holden has a pivotal role as one of the prisoners who escapes and enjoys his freedom for awhile before being asked to return with a small squadron to destroy the bridge. jack hawkins and geoffrey horne have colorful roles too and all are superb under david lean's direction.the jungle settings filmed in ceylon add the necessary realism to the project and there is never a suspension of interest although the story runs well over two-and-a-half hours. the film builds to a tense and magnificent climax with an ending that seems to be deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking. well worth watching, especially if shown in the restored letterbox version now being shown on tcm.some of the best lines go to william holden and he makes the most of a complex role--a mixture of cynicism and heroism in a character that ranks with his best anti-hero roles in films of the '50s. he brings as much conviction to his role as alec guinness does and deserved a best actor nomination that he did not get. 54 of 71 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
