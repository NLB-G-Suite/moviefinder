perhaps the plethora of homosexuals was a bit over the top, as was the part of the private investigator, but these are nit-picks hardly noticed against the background of most modern releases. while i dislike musicals intensely, this one is different, most obviously in the setting for the music. unlike the incongruous breaking out in song in the middle of conversation, this movie's music occurs within the framework of nightclub acts. this adds to the credibility of a plot that could have spun out of control, much as s.o.b. did (unfortunately). what really sets this movie apart from the crowd of box-office hits that plague us is the incredible wit of the dialogue. the writing is truly wonderful! and preston is perfect for his character, his repartee style as sharp as the lines blake edwards puts in his mouth. it is my tendency to pick apart films on the issue of credibility, allowing as we should for the genre of the film. h.g.wells once said that good science fiction depended on introducing one and only one fantastic idea, and then developing a plot whose events would follow reasonably from that one idea. bad science fiction, he said, introduces several such incredible inventions and ideas, creating a plot too fantastic for the reader to immerse him/herself in. so too with movies. good comedy, science fiction, drama, even action plots, should have one premise that might stretch the limit of credibility, and then develop the plot reasonably from there. most modern box-office hits fail to do this, and in the process of feeding us one fantasy after another to stimulate our interest and attract our dollars, dulls our minds. victor / victoria is good writing because it starts with its one major premise - an unsuccessful, though talented singer achieving fame and fortune by altering her sexual image - and lets the plot play itself out. there are a few minor stretches beside the main premise, but without fantastic physical feats, explosions, car chases, and cg effects, edwards has created a script that pulls - rather than pushes - you in to the plot. the weakest part of the plot is the fact that andrew's character attains success not just by cross-dressing, but also by substantially altering her act. we are supposed to ignore the fact that she has changed from simply singing to singing with well choreographed movement. however, this is not a serious flaw, because in the real hollywood (and broadway), very good talent is habitually unsuccessful, while the fantastic and ridiculous is placed on an altar. (does anyone really think schwarzenegger can act?) did i say acting? perhaps i saved the best for last. andrews playing herself is perfect here, garner is fantastic, and leslie ann warren adapted to her character's personality so completely that i hardly realized it was her. and, at the risk of repetition, preston is perfection itself. the set design was almost excessive in the distraction it caused, for you could not help noticing how artfully it was designed and lit. finally, henry mancini wrote the music. the dvd commentary added substantially to the production, making the entire package a 5-star offering, a rating i rarely give. 18 of 30 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 110 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: waiter labisse charles bovin manager of victoria's hotel sal andratti restaurant manager madame president richard dinardo juke ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
