"but how many people lose their faith because heaven showed them too much?" daggett nearly became a priest; now he's a cop. he may want to put religion behind him, but one morning a weird, eyeless, hermaphroditic corpse turns up. suddenly he is on a path that will put him right in the middle of a war in heaven. and once again, heaven will show him too much: gore, blood, charred flesh, living corpses and much worse. even more central to the heavenly war effort is a young girl. this american indian child has something gabriel wants. and gabriel is willing to kill her and anyone in his path - or even reanimate a corpse or two - to get it. written by j. spurlin plot summary | plot synopsis plot keywords: heaven | corpse | priest | girl | little girl |&nbsp;see all (301)&nbsp;&raquo; taglines: this film outlines the exercise of faith in a real struggle for the ultimate and most glorious of heavenly prizes. see more&nbsp;&raquo; genres: action&nbsp;| crime&nbsp;| drama&nbsp;| fantasy&nbsp;| horror&nbsp;| mystery&nbsp;| thriller motion picture rating (mpaa) rated r for violence and gore, and for some language | see all certifications&nbsp;&raquo; parents guide: view content advisory&nbsp;&raquo; edit details official sites: official site country: usa language: english release date: 1 september 1995 (usa) see more&nbsp;&raquo; also known as: god's army see more&nbsp;&raquo; filming locations: apache leap mountain, superior, arizona, usa see more&nbsp;&raquo; box office budget: $8,000,000 (estimated) gross: $16,115,878 (usa) see more&nbsp;&raquo; company credits production co: first look international, neo motion pictures, overseas filmgroup see more&nbsp;&raquo; show detailed company contact information on imdbpro&nbsp;&raquo; technical specs runtime: 98 min sound mix: ultra stereo color: color aspect ratio: 2.35 : 1 see full technical specs&nbsp;&raquo; edit did you know? trivia the film was released a year after both christopher walken and eric stoltz appeared in the academy award winning, pulp fiction as both stoltz and walken had completed work on that film prior to starting work on this film. the way one can tell is stoltz's look which he sports in quentin tarantino's film. see more &raquo; goofs the injury on the bridge of daggett's nose keeps changing size and shape. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] simon: i remember the first war, the way the sky burned, the faces of angels destroyed. i saw a third of heaven's legion banished and the creation of hell. i stood with my brothers and watched lucifer fall. but now my brothers are not brothers, and we have come here where we are mortal to steal the dark soul, not yet lucifer's, to serve our cause. i have always obeyed, but i never thought the war would happen again. see more &raquo; connections referenced in ghostwatcher 2&nbsp;(2005) see more &raquo; soundtracks angel in black written by shawn amos performed by shawn amos produced by ian slater see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what is so special about hawthorne's soul that the angels want to get their hands on it?
