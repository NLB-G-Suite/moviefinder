see all my reviews this film is one of the most expensive films ever made in france but it was worthwhile. even with such a huge budget, jean-paul rappeneau is controling very well this epic film. moreover, it shows numerous qualities which proves rappeneau's confidence towards his film, for example: the beauty of the landscapes, the performance of the two main actors: olivier martinez who is very at ease in his role of soldier and juliette binoche who is ravishing and brave too, the briskly rhythm of the film itself and the quality of the screenplay which is sometimes ironic .i didn't read the novel by jean giono but i suppose that the film is very faithful to the novel. i noticed one thing in this film which is weird: very famous french actors have got only a little role: g&eacute;rard depardieu who performs a policeman, jean yanne who is a hawker and fran&ccedil;ois cluzet who is a doctor. as a conclusion: an epic film which is worth to be seen 11 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
