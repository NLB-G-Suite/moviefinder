edit did you know? trivia during filming crispin glover would appear to be so nervous (because he was still starting out as an actor) that he would be speechless, but this improved his character of george mcfly, since george is a nervous guy. crispin glover even had to voice over for george mcfly, because he was too nervous to speak. see more &raquo; goofs in the movie doc says that the time machine is electrical, yet he uses a nuclear reaction to generate power. there is but one type of nuclear reaction that directly generates electrical energy called beta decay, and it is predominantly used for long-term low power output, unlike the high-yield output required by the time circuits. all other nuclear power sources generate heat that is only later transformed into electricity using heat engines and alternators. see more &raquo;

user reviews time travel movies are always brilliant 4 june 2002 | by big movie fan (england) &ndash; see all my reviews time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. what would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? it's something to think about.i won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen it. let's just say that michael j. fox as marty mcfly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by marty threaten his very existence. he is aided by doc brown played brilliantly by christopher lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.the movie is great-and i feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. in fact, i find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. it has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. all the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.anyone who watches this movie will love it. 111 of 137 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
