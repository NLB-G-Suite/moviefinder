see all my reviews i'm sure some people wouldn't agree with me, but this movie is a great piece of art on film. like hitchcock, coppola, and others, woody allen is a real cinema artist. he makes great use of the possibilities of cinema without losing himself in expensive special effects.of course cinema is a medium to create a near-perfect realism on a fictional story. but it can also be an artistic medium. playing with the possibilities. an example in this film is robin williams. a men who is 'out of focus'. the story is, like most films, not very original. a character that struggles with his personality and social life. but unlike most movies, you can see an artist made this film. it's a woody allen creation. his own style, his own characters, his own humor. not a collection of an expensive scriptwriter with an expensive director, an expensive special effects team , an expensive director of photography etc. to make a total non-personal creation for the big public. of course the whole crew did a perfect job, but it is surely a woody allen film!a great movie with a nice plot. some nice switching in timeline and fiction / reality (for the story that is) makes it more interesting then the story really is. also the jumpcuts, the camera movement, the cast and the humor are making this film a must see! even if you are not a woody allen fan you will like this movie. if you are a fan of big blockbuster movies (standard hollywood confention movies) this movie is a must see as well! not only to see the real art of cinema (something different then perfect special effects) but also just for a nice evening and some good humor. 20 of 25 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
