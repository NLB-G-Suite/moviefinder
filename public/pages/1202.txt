an awful mess 27 october 2001 | by dorminante (tallahassee , florida) &ndash; see all my reviews i don't understand why people would praise this garbage. its wrong , stupid , unrealistic , awful , and just about everything else. the film is a view on life , racial issues , prejudice , and everything else that strangely goes on in college. this is where it fails. it has no grasps on reality. from many questionable non-sense scenes in the movie such as for examplea black man chasing down a white man with a gun, the black man and stopped by the security guards handcuffed and carried out while the gunman runs right past them.the same white man snipering down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a rodney king style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards.as one previous reviewer pointed out several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs bust a rhymesanother critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters. from the scared and confused white people and the mean , angry , and yet rightful (?) black people. its almost as its an insult to both black and white people. i am a white male and i know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race. the storyline which i will explain now revolves around three characters. one a black athlete , the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality , and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared , then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film. they all have their share of problems and adventures including sex , rape , fights , love , hate , prejudice , racial war , and oh yeah don't forget education. which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out. in which after they go back to their boring lives and think &quot;being white is bad&quot;. does this sound alot like your college years? didn't think so. i don't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess.overall this is a really bad , bad , ugly movie. if you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see american history x. if you want to see a more accurate view of college rent porkys. just avoid this mess. 30 of 51 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
