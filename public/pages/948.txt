there is no message. the message is that school&#x27;s out and it&#x27;s time to celebrate! besides, there are a few positive points that can be mined from the proceedings: the arrogant bully gets what&#x27;s coming, make a stand and fight when you have to (even if you get beat up), ultra-tight pants must be put on with pliers &#x26; the help of a friend, be true to yourself, etc. but -- really -- this isn&#x27;t a movie to look for deep messages, its simple purpose is to take you back to the school years -- in this case, 1976 -- and all the fun &#x26; painful experiences thereof.no review of &#x22;dazed and confused&#x22; would be complete without noting the excellent soundtrack. you get some great rock/metal of the 70s like &#x22;sweet emotion,&#x22; &#x22;school&#x27;s out,&#x22; &#x22;stranglehold,&#x22; &#x22;do you feel like we do,&#x22; &#x22;love hurts,&#x22; &#x22;paranoid,&#x22; &#x22;rock &#x26; roll hootchie coo,&#x22; &#x22;rock &#x26; roll all nite,&#x22; &#x22;slow ride,&#x22; &#x22;cherry bomb,&#x22; &#x22;tuesday&#x27;s gone&#x22; and many more.grade: a 27 of 33 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
