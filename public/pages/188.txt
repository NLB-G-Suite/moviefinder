edit storyline antonio salieri believes that wolfgang amadeus mozart's music is divine and miraculous. he wishes he was himself as good a musician as mozart so that he can praise the lord through composing. he began his career as a devout man who believes his success and talent as a composer are god's rewards for his piety. he's also content as the respected, financially well-off, court composer of austrian emperor joseph ii. but he's shocked to learn that mozart is such a vulgar creature, and can't understand why god favored mozart to be his instrument. salieri's envy has made him an enemy of god whose greatness was evident in mozart. he is ready to take revenge against god and mozart for his own musical mediocrity. written by khaled salem plot summary | plot synopsis plot keywords: composer | classical composer | opera | first person narration | 1800s |&nbsp;see all (138)&nbsp;&raquo;

edit did you know? trivia during filming in 1983, czechoslovakia was under communist rule. the production team was often followed around by the secret police, and milos forman and the cast spoke about their fears that a fourth of july prank-the unfurling of the american flag in the concert hall and the singing of "the star-spangled banner" by the large cast and crew-would lead to their arrests for inciting rebellion. many suspected that their hotel rooms had been bugged during the six months they spent filming the movie.forman, who was considered a traitor for becoming an american citizen and not returning to the soviet-controlled area, had previously had one of his movies banned in the country (then called the czech socialist republic). according to twyla tharp, in order to shoot in red territory, forman had to make certain concessions. "milos had to sign an agreement that he would go to his hotel every night for the year that he was there and that his driver would be his best friend from the old days," tharp told the hollywood reporter. "and everybody knew what would happen to his best friend if something untoward politically happened around milos, because milos was a sort of local hero and he was dangerous to the authorities." see more &raquo; goofs the powder on mozart's forehead when trying on wigs before the first meeting with the emperor. after taking off the covering mask, it's inexplicably clean. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] antonio salieri: mozart! mozart, forgive your assassin! i confess, i killed you... see more &raquo; crazy credits "amadeus" was originally a national theater production in london, then produced in america by the shubert organization, elizabeth i. mccann/nelle nugent and roger berlind. see more &raquo; connections referenced in other voices: creating 'the terminator'&nbsp;(2001) see more &raquo; soundtracks caro mio ben (uncredited) written by giuseppe giordani performed by the academy of st. martin-in-the-fields conducted by neville marriner sung by michele esposito see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: what are the differences between the theatrical cut and the director's cut of the movie? q: why is this film titled with mozart's supposed middle name? q: is "amadeus" based on a book? see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews dominant best picture winner of 1984 26 september 2000 | by tfrizzell (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;amadeus&quot; is a great film that is deep, thought-provoking, and overall exceptional. the film deals with the last few months of wolfgang amadeus mozart's (oscar-nominee tom hulce) life, told in flashbacks by an old, washed-up musician named antonio salieri (oscar-winner f. murray abraham). salieri tells of the genius, the ingenuity, and the insanity of the young musician who died mysteriously at the age of 35. salieri's jealousy may have led him to kill the young composer, but that is something that will never be known. &quot;amadeus&quot; is an interesting commentary that tries to fill holes in history and succeeds amazingly. by mixing fact and probable fiction, the film-makers succeeded in creating a truly remarkable motion picture that is easily one of the best of the 1980s. 5 stars out of 5. 83 of 120 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 568 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
