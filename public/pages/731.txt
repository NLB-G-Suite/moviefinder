user reviews &nbsp; an entertaining motion picture that had women calling out the delights of true love... 1 april 2000 | by righty-sock (robertfrangie@hotmail.com) (mexico) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;this is hollywood where people come to fulfill their dreams! some dreams come true and some don&#39;t! believe in your dreams!&quot;while visiting los angeles for a week, edward lewis borrows his friend&#39;s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard... he asks a hooker for directions... she proposes to help him for 5 dollars... for $20, she accepted to show him where the stars live...edward invites her to join him in his hotel suite, but not for sex...enjoying her company, he offers her to be his &#39;date&#39; for a series of business activities including a strategic dinner and a pool match... out of the &#39;bargain,&#39; she gets $3,000 cash, a classier wardrobe and a visit to the opera...all the characters of the film are convincing, original and sympathetic, feeling comfortable with each other... director gary marshall did a great job...ideal for the role is richard gere... he plays the terrific rescuer who &#39;free&#39; vivian from the streets conducting her to his penthouse suite... he is handsome, charming and shy... &#39;henry higgins&#39; at his best... but edward lewis is a millionaire... he buys companies that are in financial difficulty... he takes them apart and sells the pieces for more than he paid for the whole... &quot;it&#39;s strictly business&quot;, he tells vivian... &quot;you and i are both such similar people. we both screw people for money.&quot; edward&#39;s only defect is that he hurts what he loves... he wins a certain imaginative power by how painful that treason is...julia roberts plays vivian ward, an attractive and smart hooker with a heart of gold... she gives her character a great sense of humor, charming edward with her honesty... she is intensely appealing and amusing, making any man feel comfortable...into the snobbish clothing store, she delivers a great exit line, just devastating the saleswomen... the song is terrific as the scene... in the hotel lobby, she walks in a &#39;killer&#39; red dress... she learns which fork to use in the formal dinner meeting, projecting an escargot through the air... at the opera she innocently asks: &quot;where&#39;s the band?&quot;there&#39;s more than a touch of eliza dolittle in her role, specially when she decides she wants more from edward than money... she gets the perfect rescue scene with a limousine, a fire escape, a balcony, birds, music and red flowers...hector elizondo turns a supporting role into more than that... he plays the formal, intolerant hotel manager... he takes an affection to his best customer&#39;s &quot;niece&quot; and trains her on which fork to use at a fancy dinner... his amusing performance as edward&#39;s smooth competent hotel manager nearly shapes roberts and gere...ralph bellamy is incredibly good as the aging millionaire, creator of a small company edward is trying to take to pieces...laura san giacomo plays vivian&#39;s pal roommate, her first role since she played the amorous sister in &quot;sex, lies &amp; videotape.&quot;&quot;pretty woman&quot; is a contemporary hollywood fairy tale, a sweet romantic comedy, an innocent love story in the middle of self-interest and agreement... it remains as an entertaining motion picture that had women calling out the delights of true love...keep on dreaming! 59 of 96 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
