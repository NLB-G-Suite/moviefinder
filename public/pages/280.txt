edit storyline roy 'tin cup' mcavoy, a failed pro golfer who lives at the run-down driving range which he manages with his sidekick and caddy romeo in the west texas tin pot town of salome, ends up signing over ownership to a madam of 'show girls' to pay off debts. his foxy novice golf pupil, female psychiatrist dr. molly griswold, turns out to be the new girlfriend of mcavoy's sarcastic one-time college golf partner, slick pga superstar david simms, who drops by to play into roy's fatal flaw: the inability to resist a dare, all too often causing him to lose against lesser players, in this case gambling away his car. falling for molly, roy decides to become her patient; in order to earn her respect, he decides to try to qualify for the us open, after starting off as simm's caddy 'for the benefit of his experience'. his talent proves more then adequate, but over-confident negligence of risks, while pleasing the crowds, is murder on his scores, while simms spits on the fans but never wastes a point... written by kgf vissers plot summary | add synopsis plot keywords: driving range | golf lesson | golf tournament | golf pro | professional sports |&nbsp;see all (16)&nbsp;&raquo;

", and goes into naming his sponsors. among the list, he says "woody's steak house". if you look at the shirt he's wearing, it says "wally's steak house", and not "woody's". see more &raquo; goofs cbs golf producer lance barrow offers that salome is in west texas near floydada. floydada is in the panhandle about 60 miles east of lubbock, not near fort stockton as the road signs at the first of the movie suggest. barrow is from floydada and was probably giving a shout out to folks back home. see more &raquo; quotes roy 'tin cup' mcavoy: if i had it to do all over again, i'd still hit that shot. romeo: man, you'd bury yourself alive just to prove you could handle the shovel. see more &raquo; connections referenced in mike and mike in the morning: episode dated 16 june 2016&nbsp;(2016) see more &raquo; soundtracks double bogey blues written by dave gillon performed by mickey jones see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews i have seen this film 20 times, and it only get&acute;s better... 2 january 2004 | by max koljonen (helsinki, finland) &ndash; see all my reviews first of all, this is a golf film. a great golf film. the best golf film. but there is more to it than just being a golf film. it&acute;s the classic tale of a washed-up hero wanting to get the girl. but kevin costner gives this role something more. okay, it&acute;s not an oscar-winning role, but the performance sure as heck should be.and it&acute;s nice to see a golf film with a screenwriter who actually seems to know what the game really is about. for those who are not into golf, just look at mr. costner&acute;s every move and how he delivers his lines as a drunken golf pro. in fact the whole cast is excellent. in comparison to films like bagger vance, happy gilmore and caddyshack this film is the only one that explains why we men are so hooked on this game. if you see this movie more than five times, the music might start to get on your nerves. but it&acute;s okay, it&acute;s impossible to add music to a golf film, because the sport itself is so timeless and silent. 13 of 18 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 75 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: david simms doreen earl dewey clint curt jose turk boone ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
