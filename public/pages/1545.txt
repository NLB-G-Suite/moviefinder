see all my reviews the success of high noon caused many westerns to be made which had a lot in common.actually it created a new genre, the &quot;high noon &quot;style western. this is certainly one of them, and one that came out very good. it has many assets, like the script by dalton trumbo and the direction of joseph h lewis. it has also a great performance by sterling hayden. he gives us the best moments of the film as the swede who does not yet understand what is going on the town. ned young and carol kelly as the mean gunfighter and his suffering girlfriend also stand out. another very meaningful character is eugene martin as pepe mirada a man who lives in fear. the duel of hayden against young, where hayden is using an harpoon is extremely well filmed. considering its low ambitions &quot;terror in a texas town&quot; is quite an accomplishment. 13 of 16 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 33 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo;
