see all my reviews i have seen this many times and never grow tired of watching it. it seems the more i watch it, the funnier it gets. it is freaking hilarious!i especially think that steve buscemi and brendan fraser are the funniest in this flick. i love the girl that played chazz's girlfriend as well, the way she would beat the crap out of chazz was too much!i don't think that anybody that ever was in a rock-roll band could watch this movie without cracking up. i guess maybe you had to be there? if you haven't seen this film i recommend that you rent it, or better yet buy a copy to add to your collection. this is a classic rock-n-roll comedy that you must see. 21 of 29 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
