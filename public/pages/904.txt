see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; well-executed, well acted, interesting story 16 january 2005 | by gary murphy (glm@hilbertinc.com) (olathe, ks, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews based on the trailers, i expected this to be a low-budget, b-movie that showed off the anatomies of pretty girls - not that that is entirely bad - but i do expect more from a movie.in actuality, this is a very, very good plot that is executed well by the principal actors. neve campbell, denise richards (surprisingly), and especially matt dillion turn in very good performances. i always enjoy bill murray and his part in this movie, although fairly small, adds some levity.i can't comment too much on this movie without spoiling it, except to say that things aren't always what they expect to be. there are a lot of plot twists, some that probably couldn't stand tremendous scrutiny, but are realistic enough to keep the audience engaged.the other technical aspects of the movie - direction and cinematography are done very well, too. that is, they are unobtrusive.this really is a thoroughly entertaining film, and while it does contain one rather steamy scene, is not a cheap sex film, but a well-thought out, well-executed story. i highly recommend it. 36 of 44 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
