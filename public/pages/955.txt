i'd like to think that it could, but then i am nothing but a hopeless romantic. the final scene always tears my heart out, no matter how many times i've seen it, i'm always sobbing. watching this film around valentine's day (even if you are single) is always a treat. it allows our fantasies to take flight so that we may think that we are actually the one meeting our beloved atop the empire state building in a thunderstorm.watch with a box of kleenex nearby.my rating: 4 stars 29 of 40 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
