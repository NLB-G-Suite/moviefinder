see all my reviews private investigator harry d'amour must stop a supernatural cult from raising nix, a man with god-like powers, who was killed 13 years before hand. now he's back, and he must save illusionist philip swann and his wife, dorothea. clive barker's &quot;lord of illusions&quot; may not be his ultimate masterpiece, but it sure is an entertaining horror film. pretty good performances from most of the lead cast members, though kevin j. o'connor was a little wooden as philip swann. the make-up effects, courtesy of the boys at knb fx, are really cool, and there's enough gore (my favorite being the messy &quot;sword accident&quot; scene) to satisfy horror fans. the visual effects were also very well-done for the most part.an enjoyable, well-done horror film overall. not a masterpiece but gory, fun and often imaginative. worth a viewing.6/10. 15 of 21 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
