oh well.considering it was based on the short story of the same name by cyberpunk godfather william gibson, the movie is a minor disappointment. it's not that bad, but it could have been so much better.however, a lot of gibson's ideas are still there, making it a solid cyberpunk movie. there aren't too many of those around. 40 of 59 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
