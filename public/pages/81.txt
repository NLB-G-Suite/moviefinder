user reviews &nbsp; incredible movie 4 october 2005 | by stacorpus (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by john williams, incredible directing. i believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) steven spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. it also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the t-rex, the scene with the t-rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the t-rex chases the jeep. i will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die. 124 of 146 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
