see all my reviews this is the type of movie tony scott should have stuck to creating. while most jerry bruckheimer films prove to be bad, modern interpretations of old school martial arts movies, this was one of the better films bruckheimer ever produced. while the story was completely plot-driven and the performances a little over the top, the rivalry between denzel washington and gene hackman made this film a cut above the rest of the trash bruckheimer tends to produce. while simple and direct, it proves to be effective in the annals of storytelling, never overindulging the viewer. 24 of 35 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
