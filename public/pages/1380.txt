frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews doesn&#x27;t have the heart of the first, but arguably an improvement over tgva 3 june 2012 | by gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews even though the second film lacked the heart of the original which was in my opinion one of bluth&#x27;s best films, it was pretty passable with it&#x27;s nice animation and some decent villains. while i think that this is an improvement over the great valley adventure, it also lacks the heart of the original.the story about the value of friendship, teamwork, and sharing was a nice idea and i think that it has some very nice dialog with such hilarious quotes including &#x22;me go play bullies somewhere else&#x22; and &#x22;me unscareable&#x22;. the animation is beautiful with some lovely colors, but also has some flat backgrounds due to it&#x27;s below average editing. the songs, although not great, are very pleasant to listen too. the strongest aspects is the wonderful music from michael travera and it&#x27;s excellent voice acting.scott mcafee did very decent as littlefoot and his singing was pretty good. i also liked linda gary and kenneth mars as littlefoot&#x27;s grandparents. john ingle&#x27;s narration was clunky, but cera&#x27;s father&#x27;s gruff characterization really amused me.overall, while an improvement on the great valley adventure, it doesn&#x27;t have the heart of the original, but it&#x27;s still worth watching. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
