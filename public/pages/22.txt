edit did you know? trivia between the time robert de niro signed a $35,000 contract to appear in this film and when it began filming, he won an oscar for his role in the godfather: part ii (1974) and his profile soared. the producers were terrified that de niro would ask for a deserved large pay raise, since columbia was very discomfited by the project and were looking for excuses to pull the plug on it, but de niro said he would honor his original deal so the film would get made. see more &raquo;
