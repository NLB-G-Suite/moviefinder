user reviews &nbsp; shagadelic, baby, yeah! 28 july 2002 | by kristine (kristinedrama14@msn.com) (chicago, illinois) &ndash; see all my reviews when i saw &quot;austin powers&quot;, i was on the floor laughing. this movie has every single memorable line you could possibly imagine. from &quot;yeah, baby!&quot; to &quot;riiiiiight&quot;, mike myers is a genius when it comes to comedy! i think everyone could say that they laughed at least once to this film.paroding of the james bond flicks, austin powers is an international spy who is a lady's man. dr. evil, is arch nemesis, goes into the future of 1997 and now austin must travel through time to find him. when he gets to 1997, he has a beautiful assistant, vanessa, who happens to be the daughter of his former flame in the 60's. vanessa resists austin's charm and wants to stick to business while austin is wasting no time to get to his &quot;business&quot; with her. dr. evil learns that he has a son, scott played by seth green. when scott isn't as excited to have dr. evil as a father, dr. evil tries anything he can to get scott to love him, including a hilarious scene in a counseling group for father's and son's. but back into action, austin must find dr. evil before he rules the world with his kitty, mr. bigglesworth. but can he do that and have vanessa at the same time? you'll just have to see! my favorite characters that worked so well together was without a doubt seth and mike as dr. evil and scott. they are just beyond hilarious and work so well together. i think a lot of the other austin powers fans would agree. there first scene together meeting is just really funny, &quot;give daddy a hug! i'm down with the kids, ducka ducka ducka!&quot; &quot;no! get away from me you psycho!&quot;. classic! like i said &quot;austin powers&quot; is just a great and funny movie that i think you can get into if you're looking for a decent comedy. come on! we still say &quot;yeah, baby!&quot; to this very day after all! let's give mike some credit here! 8/10 13 of 19 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 431 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
