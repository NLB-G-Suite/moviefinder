frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; light neo-noir 7 july 2006 | by manuel-pestalozzi (zurich, switzerland) &ndash; see all my reviews i bought a video tape of this movie because of erika eleniak. she bears a striking resemblance with french acting legend simone signoret, but unfortunately does not share her talents. however, in this movie i have seen eleniak&#39;s best performance by far, and she shows unexpected potential.based on a story by james b. cain, the movie has a distant feel of film noir. but it is a light, rather harmless affair. the actors are overall clean and kind and shiny, any kind of depravity or sorrow is sort of glossed over. it is actually quite pleasant to watch. the director apparently mainly makes documentaries, this influences the style of this movie favorably. the locations are well chosen and well filmed. experienced actors like valerie perrine, michael lehrer and bud cort give good support to the young couple, played by eleniak and william mcnamara. the chemistry between the characters is quite good, especially between the young lovers who are quite believable in their parts. so, it&#39;s good entertainment and not a waste of time. 1 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
