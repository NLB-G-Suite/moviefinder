witty and charming, one of allen's greatest achievements. 14 may 2004 | by boycebrown-1 &ndash; see all my reviews annie hall is a movie about life. in recent films, there are fairly predictable endings. (i.e. guy gets girl after chase scene in manhattan). annie hall goes against the grain of movies. there is definite chemistry between allen and keaton. that is one of the main reasons this movie is successful. alvy and annie do not have high wage jobs, they do not go clubbing, nor are they incredibly attractive. why does a movie character relationship have to be so extreme it's unconvincing? these days movie producers create plots that are unbelievable. they don't have any depth and usually have shallow intentions. you can sense that the two leads care for each other. the situations in this movie resemble real life and that is why it is so critically acclaimed and remembered. sure woody talked into the camera, but that, in a sense is real life as well. it reminds me of my usual thought process and how when i think; i feel as though i'm presenting my thoughts to myself. only he is, presenting it to us. this movie is clever and thought provoking. if you're looking for the opposite of a yearly run of the mill movie, this is for you. 69 of 100 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 503 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: mom hall dad hall grammy hall alvy's dad alvy's mom alvy's aunt ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
