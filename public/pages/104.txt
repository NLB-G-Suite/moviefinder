trivia the movie was made and released about forty-one years after the character of sgt. bilko was first seen portrayed by phil silvers in 1955 on episode #8.53 of toast of the town (1948) [see: toast of the town: episode #8.53 (1955)].the character later became a regular on the the phil silvers show (1955). see more &raquo; goofs during the sequence where the soldiers are on the field attempting to drill with rifles, one of the soldiers has a negligent discharge. there are 2 errors here. the rifle has no magazine in it therefore there would be no ammunition. you can still chamber a round with no magazine but the armory would never permit loading one round only into the chamber and issuing a weapon. the second error is that if a negligent discharge had occurred, the shooter would've been detained and an immediate investigation by military police would have been conducted. see more &raquo; quotes bilko: you manipulated me! how could you?
