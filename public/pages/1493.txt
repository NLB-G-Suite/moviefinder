frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; life is but a dream 8 july 2005 | by polexia_rogue (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews like an ancient poem the ideas, meaning and even aspects of the plot are left up to interpretation. this is a movie for anyone who has ever been so bored with his or current situation that he or she can just lay back and dream up a world of love, death,sex, drugs and aliens abductions and the end of the all life as we know it. each character is kind one sided as we see the world through the eyes of dark, the aptly named lead; these are not representations of all teens but only the annoying stereotypes as they relate to dark's life. so taking all that in to account this is a great movie to share with friends (and confuse the heck out of them) or to watch when you're feeling a little bored yourself. with sets painted wild colors and out of place visuals it's clear that for dark-life is but a dream. 12 of 19 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
