edit did you know? trivia a sizeable amount of battle scene footage was left out of the final cut, but a use was soon found for it. outtakes were used to provide battle scenes in fireball forward (1972). the film was also produced by frank mccarthy and edmund h. north wrote the screenplay. morgan paull also appeared in this production see more &raquo; goofs contrary to the way it's portrayed in the film, the controversy over george s. patton's knutsford speech was not over his having insulted the russians (in fact, the army quickly revised the initial transcript of his remarks to reflect that he had mentioned them). it had to do with his talk of &quot;ruling the world&quot; after the war - members of congress said he had no business as a general commenting on post-war political affairs, while others objected to the notion of the us, britain or anyone else &quot;ruling the world.&quot;

crazy credits one of the very, very few twentieth century-fox films in which that company's logo is not shown at all, beginning or end. the film simply begins with the opening speech, and the opening fox logo is replaced with an in-credit text-only notice after the speech. however, recent television showings have added the logo (not on dvd prints), and the addition is obviously spliced in from another piece of film. see more &raquo;
