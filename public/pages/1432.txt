victoria foyt outstanding in stellar cast 7 december 2008 | by btm1 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews if, like me, you don&#39;t know much about legitimate theater and how serious actors learn their craft, nor how that contrasts with hollywood&#39;s business, you will find this a pleasurable and informative look into an actors&#39; retreat and workshop.victoria foyt stars as a young actress made famous by a starring role in films about a wonder woman super hero. she has managed to be invited to a retreat run by a grand dame of legitimate theater, played by grand dame of legitimate theater viveca lindfors in her last role. besides her acting role, victoria foyt is also listed as one of the writers of the movie, and maybe had something to do with getting it made. i had never heard of victoria foyt but thought she was truly outstanding, particularly in her training exercises playing a variety of animals. maybe she wrote the script as a means of showcasing her talent. i found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable. 3 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
