(stood the test of time, eh!!) (widescreen is a must for these.) leone's films exhibit an idealism in art that surpassed his hollywood models (eg: ford). although, at the time of creation, i doubt he would have thought he was. he simply had a vision.from film to film he improved on this. like most artists, i don't think he was too concerned with the financial gains that might or might not be realized.(this was probably his downfall). that these little films can impress all you younger fans so much says a lot about good taste and the sad lack of it in american films of recent times.great directors, like leone, don't come along every day and it saddens me greatly to know he died before he was recognised for the genius he surely was. morricone must be 75 now, soon we will loose him too. i am a successful composer in australia and can tell you, without bias, that morricone is in the top five best ever film composers just from these four films alone, if not one of the best composers in general (yes, this includes stravinsky, bartok, debussy and schoenberg.) of the 20th century. eastwood is also reaching the end of his life and although i'm not a huge fan of his recent work, he is one of the last living greats. without the inspirations put forth by these men, i might not still be writing and recording my music these days. plenty of times i could have stopped when things got tough but all i had to do was revisit these gems of modern art to realise that greatness does still exhist , all you have to have is the love and desire and guts to make your visions a reality. leone, morricone and eastwood: i salute you. 135 of 232 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 581 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: sheriff - auctioneer barman ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
