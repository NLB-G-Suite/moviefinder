trivia director/writer/actor albert brooks asked nancy reagan (who used to act under the name nancy davis) to play the part of his mother. nancy really wanted to come out of acting retirement to play the role, but declined because she couldn't bear to be away from husband and former president ronald reagan, suffering from alzheimer's disease. also on brooks' list of former actresses to play his mother was doris day, but she showed no interest in coming out of acting retirement. brooks is an old friend of actress/writer carrie fisher, and he knew her famous mother (debbie reynolds) through her. (debbie used to try to pair albert and carrie off for marriage.) brooks was looking for a big-name actress from the past and called fisher to see if she thought her mother would accept the role. fisher said yes, as did reynolds. see more &raquo; goofs rob morrow's (jeff) hairstyle changes slightly between shots when he visits his mother; when he appears outside of the house (after storming out following an argument with his brother) his bangs are longer and 'up' whereas in the previous shots they were shorter and down on his forehead. see more &raquo; quotes john henderson: you're running a food museum here. see more &raquo; connections referenced in the tonight show with jay leno: episode #21.56&nbsp;(2012) see more &raquo; soundtracks fascination by f.d. marchetti performed by fantastic strings courtesy of laserlight digital by arrangement with source/q see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; mother love 9 december 2004 | by paul2001sw-1 (paul2001sw@yahoo.co.uk) (saffron walden, uk) &ndash; see all my reviews albert's brooks' comedy 'mother' is frequently hilarious, with some cracking dialogue, and highly perceptive: few viewers will fail to recognise some aspect of their relationships with their family in its portrayal of its eponymous central character and her middle-aged son, played by brooks himself. but in taking their interaction as its principal subject, instead of using it as a backdrop to a wider story, the film chooses to pursue limited ambitions, and there's a level of contrivance necessary to support this narrow focus: while, at a micro-level, the film is perfect, the overall plot makes less sense, and the ending is a little pat. not a great film; but one guaranteed to make you smile. 6 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 54 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: lawyer karen henderson john henderson carl tv installer tv installer donna linda jeff henderson cheryl henderson jill henderson josh henderson helen alice ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
