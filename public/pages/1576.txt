a surprise 16 december 1999 | by jugophon (jugophone@hotmail.com) (usa) &ndash; see all my reviews i caught this film on canadian television, and i was startled by the risque content being broadcast on a non-pay station. this is a story of a growing adolescent boy in a war-torn europe. the focus of the movie is in the complex relationships he holds with the people in his life. the controversial nature may deter the more conservative american; however, the characters are well-rounded and acted and the cinematography is superb. i have a feeling this director may be famous in his home country, there is a touch of epic brilliance in the movement of the scenes. 13 of 18 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
