quotes [first lines] narrator: long ago, in the faraway land of ancient greece, there was a golden age of powerful gods and extraordinary heroes. and the greatest and strongest of all these heroes was the mighty hercules. but what is the measure of a true hero? ah, that is what our story is... thalia: will you listen to him? he's makin' the story sound like some greek tragedy. terpsichore: lighten up, dude. calliope: we'll take it from here, darling. narrator: you go, girl. see more &raquo;

user reviews &nbsp; hey mythology lovers, get a grip! 29 june 2004 | by rapier7 (ajax) &ndash; see all my reviews i have seen many disney movies, animated and not, and this one has more action than most, has no cute animals and is more humorous (ala aladdin) than a typical disney movie--pixar films not included. this one also has a male lead (no princesses). if you are looking for typical disney fare, then you may not appreciate this one. we enjoyed it thoroughly--from 4 to 40 years of age, male and female.as for all the criticism regarding the liberties disney took with greek mythology, get a grip. i love greek mythology too but hey, it's fiction! it's not historical fact. even the ancient tales themselves are not consistent, containing contradictions. there were many authors. but the characters are interesting, and disney used some of them to create a good story for kids about an outcast looking for his place in life. it also explores what makes a hero a true hero (perhaps the more useful lesson of the movie). yes, it's a shame they took so many liberties with this picture but it still encourages interest in greek myth. don't believe me? the teenage mutant ninja turtles were not historically accurate either but they got kids interested in the old masters!8 / 10 30 of 41 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
