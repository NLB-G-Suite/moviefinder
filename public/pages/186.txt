trivia in the book sergeant gerheim (as he was known) isn't near as vulgar, but calls people into his office or the showers to beat them in private. he encourages other punishments -some worse- or orders the other recruits to perform. r. lee ermey once recalled that story and pointed out that any di who ever tried something like that would never have been able to command respect among his recruits again. see more &raquo; goofs at the beginning when the marine recruits are being lectured and/or questioned by hartmann by their bunks, cowboy's, joker's, pyle's and another's (possibly snowball's) bunks change position relative to one another. in fact, it seems that this is a constant continuity problem when the marines are depicted in the barracks. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] gunnery sergeant hartman: i am gunnery sergeant hartman, your senior drill instructor. from now on you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be "sir". do you maggots understand that?
