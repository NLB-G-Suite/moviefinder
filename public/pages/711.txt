see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews &nbsp; probably much funnier today than in 1995 3 september 2004 | by dawn millsap (michigan city, indiana, united states of america) &ndash; see all my reviews i remember hearing poor reviews from siskel and ebert for this film when it came out. and i see what they meant, as i watch it today. it's not as snappy as it could have been, but there are some extremely funny lines. and it's especially timely to see the news anchors and &quot;journalists&quot; jumping on the hate-canada bandwagon, because they still do that today, and seeing how ridiculous the arguments are against canada makes one think about the dubious arguments made against other countries by our &quot;journalists.&quot;kevin pollack is really funny, as is john candy. rhea pearlman is overly &quot;quirky,&quot; in my view, but otherwise, i think it really rings true today. it's worth a rental! 25 of 36 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
