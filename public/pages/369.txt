underrated mastery of unnamed genres... kind of 9 may 2004 | by traantz (santa rosa, california) &ndash; see all my reviews two weeks ago, my sister bought a vcr from one of her friends... vhs... scary enough. for her ten bucks she also got two dozen movies... judge dredd was one of themsince i popped this movie in, i have watched it at the very least two dozen times. i watched it once today, once yesterday, twice the day before that, three times the day before that, twice the day before that... and i have a decent selection of other films to choose from. this movie is addictive. it has this pacing and style that, while not very realistic, and certainly not worthy of an oscar, it just makes you grin. every time the alan silvestri dredd theme pops up, i just smile... from the gianni versace designed dredd armor, to the top-notch special effects, this movie brings together many elements into a 96 minute ride of pure cheese that keeps getting better each time you watch itthe cg can be beautiful at times, even to the point of photorealism, and certainly outdoes the the horrid cartooniness of blade 2's or x-men's cg...you just have to watch it to believe how addictive this damn thing is'nuff said 61 of 107 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
