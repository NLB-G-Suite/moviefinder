well, not to rain on anyone&#x27;s love-fest, but we have vigilante justice here and a murder, seemingly justified and certainly agreeable to the audience since the victim was a brutal rapist. men are not exactly banished, but they are put in their place, serving or (literally) servicing women. what is banished is orthodox religiosity in the form of a hypocritical cleric who (with his disciples, we are told) goes to town and becomes a social worker (!). this is also an ode to feminism and a deliberate tear-jerker that manipulates the emotions of the audience. yet, somehow gorris, who also wrote the script, manages not to offend my sensitivities. i think it is because the movie amounts to a very effective sermon against prejudice of any kind, and because of the gentle humanity of her tale.you&#x27;ll forgive me, however, if i say that my favorite part was the handstand! it was just perfect. 29 of 40 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
