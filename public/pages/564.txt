user reviews i usually am indifferent about costner,however 29 september 2004 | by senator_noc (new orleans) &ndash; see all my reviews in some people's criticisms of the flick i usually see &quot;he was dull&quot; or &quot;he didn't give the character life,&quot; and i have to disagree. in actuality he gave the best rendition of the real wyatt earp and his life. the movie is a biopic, and for historians like myself it served its purpose, in showing the life and true personality of a figure hollywood overglamourized. wyatt earp was not the type to dance in the snow and was indeed a cold hearted sob. i prefer this to tombstone and no doubt costner was better than russell. and actually quaid was the better doc. i wouldn't say it was a classic movie and spaghetti western versions of the story might be more &quot;entertaining,&quot; however the darkness of costner's movie is chilling and is the version that gets more replay value from me. 56 of 85 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 148 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
