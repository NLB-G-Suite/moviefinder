edit did you know? trivia this film served as something of a template for "dragnet," which debuted on radio the following year, right down to the "this is the city" style opening narration, and the fact that a disclaimer appears at the beginning informing the audience that the names have been changed to protect the innocent. see more &raquo; goofs when martin flees from his bungalow into the sewer system, the first shot shows him running in the sewer with a torch and a bag in his hand. this is the same shot as used earlier on in the film after he started robbing liquor stores. (in this later scene, he did not have a bag when he fled the bungalow nor when he entered the sewers.) see more &raquo; quotes narrator: [referring to the composite sketch] they showed that picture to the inmates of jails and prisons, to men with a wide acquaintance among the cat burglars and the violence boys, informers, con men, and sharpshooters - those on the fringe of crime and those deep in the rackets. many wanted to help - nobody could! no one in the underworld recognized that mysterious face. he was as unknown as if he had lived in the 16th century. see more &raquo; connections featured in menace ii society&nbsp;(1993) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews werker at his best 29 may 2000 | by cabotcove (cabotcove@email.com) (montclair, nj) &ndash; see all my reviews wryly directed understated film is an example of alfred werker's underrated genius at its best. basehart is magnificent as a crook who gets in over his head. scott brady and roy roberts are equally good in their roles. and the redoubtable whit bissell is on hands for a key supporting role. 18 of 22 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 73 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
