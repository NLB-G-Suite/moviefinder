(madison, wi.) &ndash; see all my reviews i liked this film. it tells the real-life story of dorothy day, who founded the &quot;catholic worker&quot; newspaper and relief agency for the poor in new york city during the depression. moira kelly gives a very good performance as day. the story follows her quest to find her way in life, ultimately leading to her helping thousands of people and providing a role model for activists.the film contains a scene where kelly says one of the most quotable lines ever: &quot;if you feed the poor, you're called a saint. if you ask why they're poor, you're called a communist.&quot; kelly says this during a scene when she is responding to people who resist her search for the truth through her newspaper. americans who are concerned with political freedom and justice should keep this statement in mind - it is especially salient today.that said, there are flaws in &quot;entertaining angels.&quot; kelly's performance as the younger dorothy day is great, but in the film day is supposed gradually to look older, and this aging process isn't convincing. martin sheen also has a part as a wandering, christ-like, populist preacher. he's ok here, but his inspector clouseau-like french accent won't be on his career retrospective videotape. also, the film might have bitten off more than it can chew. it could have used a bigger budget and a more professional cast.overall, though, this one is well worth a rental. i'm a big moira kelly fan, too. i hope she will be around a long time. 5 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 9 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: sister aloysius mike gold maggie bowen lionel moise floyd dell cardinal tamar dan irwin john tesse frankie ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
