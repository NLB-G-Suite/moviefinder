trivia carol sobieski wrote the first draft of the screenplay, which the director and producers thought were wonderful - but it wasn't the movie they wanted to do. next, fannie flagg was brought on to do another draft and she finished seventy pages before quitting. with no money left to hire another writer, director jon avnet took it upon himself to write the screenplay and spent the next three years doing so. he did, however, stay in close contact with flagg to make sure he stayed true to her book. see more &raquo; goofs when evelyn was knocking out the wall in her house she was using a sledgehammer with a long handle but when ed comes in the sledgehammer was smaller and the handle was shorter. see more &raquo; quotes ninny threadgoode: i'm worried about my little friend evelyn. she said her husband, ed, would just be sitting around watching his sports on tv... and she has an urge to hit him in the head with a baseball bat. janeen: oh hell, that seems normal to me. see more &raquo; connections referenced in fish out of water&nbsp;(2009) see more &raquo; soundtracks cannon ball performed by nora lee king courtesy of rosetta records, inc. see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: is 'fried green tomatoes' based on a book?
