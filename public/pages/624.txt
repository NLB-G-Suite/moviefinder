please write another !! william styron, stand forth ! because of her absorption into her characters and the many nuances she developed in &quot;choice&quot;, take a look at &quot;the deer hunter&quot; to see how powerfully she played an un-extraordinarily plain woman perfectly. under-playing a character, to make you believe people are actually like that, is the mark of a great actress.i ardently pray there will be another role for ms. streep - even in her older years - that will allow us to become totally engrossed, to get outside of our own lives, to become completely destroyed, delirious, shattered just for a couple of hours, to realize there is still such talent in the world - that we can afford to watch, at least.....thank heavens for this magical film..... 44 of 53 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
