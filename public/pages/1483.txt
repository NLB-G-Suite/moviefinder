goofs khaila could not have known that isaiah &quot;liked to play with blocks&quot;, since she had not had him with her while he was growing up from infancy, and he&#39;d always just sullenly moped around whenever he was at her apartment and never wanted to play or interact with the other children at day-care, so khaila would never have seen isaiah when he was truly just &quot;at play&quot; and thus learned what toys were his favorites. see more &raquo; quotes rehab leader: [as khaila suddenly bursts into tears] khaila, what is it? what's wrong? khaila richards: i killed him. rehab leader: what? khaila richards: my baby. i killed my baby. i threw him in the trash can. see more &raquo;
