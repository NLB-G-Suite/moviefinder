user reviews amidst controversy, bond re-invented with brosnan... 13 april 2004 | by ben burgraff (cariart) (las vegas, nevada) &ndash; see all my reviews goldeneye, the long-delayed debut of pierce brosnan as james bond, was a film mired in mgm's convoluted legal problems for six years, problems which had nothing to do with the 007 franchise, but which happened to fall at the worst possible time; after timothy dalton's 'serious bond' experiment, licence to kill, failed to break even in u.s. markets. despite international grosses that made the film a profitable venture, many american critics, long grumbling that the bond series had outlasted it's welcome, heaped abuse on the newer, leaner direction for 'bond', and it's taciturn, less light-hearted star...and, with mgm's decision to put the expensive series 'on hold' until their own legal and financial issues could be resolved, licence to kill became the unfair 'scapegoat' for the delay.much happened during the six-year hiatus; with the collapse of the soviet union, the communist undercurrent of many bond films (and the subject of most of ian fleming's novels) was lost; richard maibaum, the series' most prolific screenwriter, passed away, and ill health forced legendary producer albert ('cubby') broccoli to turn over his duties to his daughter barbara, and stepson, michael g. wilson (thus ending the other 'prime' 007 screenwriter's script contributions); many other key production figures would retire, die, or move on; and finally, as the delay continued, timothy dalton, nearing 50, announced that he was no longer interested in playing james bond (sparking rumors that eon productions, no longer honor-bound by the senior broccoli's choices, had given him 'the boot').while all this opened the door for pierce brosnan's long-awaited debut as 007 (after his aborted first attempt, in the living daylights), with a new 'look' and style for the franchise, whether audiences would even accept a new 'james bond' adventure was in doubt. fortunately, everything 'worked'. brosnan, now 42, was more ruggedly believable as 007 than he would have been, at 34, and dame judi dench, as the first woman 'm' (referring to bond as a &quot;sexist, misogynist dinosaur&quot;), proved a perfect successor to the late bernard lee. while the plot of the film, involving the master plan of a renegade russian general (gottfried john) and an assumed dead 006 (sean bean) to use an electronic warfare system (goldeneye) against england was nothing new, brosnan's daring-do and one-liners (with humor restored to the franchise), as he proved his value in the new world 'order', found an audience 'primed' for james bond's return...and the welcome cameo of the series' last original 'regular', &quot;q&quot; (desmond llewelyn, 81, and as cranky as ever), cemented 007's links to both the past and the future.james bond's greatest crisis, whether he still had 'box office', had been overcome, and with audience favorite pierce brosnan in place, his emergence into the 21st century was assured. 67 of 95 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
