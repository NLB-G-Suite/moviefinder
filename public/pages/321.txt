see all my reviews david cronenburg's interesting but flawed film 'crash', adapted from james ballard's novel (ballard also gives his name to the leading character), attracted huge amounts of controversy on its release and has one of the most striking voting profiles on imdb that i have seen - also equal returns for every number from 1 to 10. in fact, there's a lot of admire in this sweaty, atmospheric adaptation that perfectly captures the sense of heightened alienation that charactersises much of ballard's prose. while among the cast, deborah kara unger is sexy as always, elias koteas is suitably creepy and even james spader is kind-of ok, if you don't mind him doing that &quot;lost little college boy grown up to be a pervert&quot; thing that he first perfected as graham in 'sex, lies, and videotape', a role he basically reprises here.but - and let's get real for a minute - this is a film about people who are turned on by car crashes! now, what the hell is that all about? if you ask me, the film is trying to say something about the need for transgression in an age with no real taboos - so its characters push at an endlessly receding door, until in the end only death itself can offer a way out. the problem is that the film suffers from the same problems as the world it portrays - these people have no moral rules, so their actions carry no implications beyond themselves - which leaves us with an idea, with happenings, but no narrative &quot;drive&quot; as such. without anything to set against their nihilistic desires, 'crash' coveys no sense of tragedy; just driving around in cars, with sex. 50 of 89 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 298 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
