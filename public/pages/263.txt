user reviews &nbsp; lliam is great 3 february 2012 | by sherrie smith (dallas) &ndash; see all my reviews multiple people have compared this to neeson&#x27;s 2008 release of &#x22;taken.&#x22; both have a similar concept; liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. this time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. unlike &#x22;taken,&#x22; &#x22;unknown&#x22; is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. there are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. the movie&#x27;s plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. we are confused like neeson&#x27;s character and there are times we don&#x27;t know if he will succeed. there are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.in short, &#x22;unknown&#x22; is a fairly decent mystery thriller. good performances. good story for a mystery. good music. good cinematography&#x97;i particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film&#x27;s location&#x27;s bleak weather. good twists. good suspense&#x97; the sound mixers must&#x27;ve had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. the one thing i will note is that liam neeson is really showing his age. this is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. it gets tiresome that hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation. it is nice to see an aging actor play an upper middle-aged man who has perhaps lost his mind while running away from people trying to kill him. 19 of 24 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
