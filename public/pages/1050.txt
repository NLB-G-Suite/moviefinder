another caveat: i haven't read the book. the movie apparently takes great liberties with the book. if this kind of thing bothers you, stay away.alfonso cuaron shows a deft handling of the sense of wonder here. when he was announced as the director of harry potter 3, his work on little princess made me confident he'd deliver the goods. one reviewer tried to declare that &quot;princess&quot; was a calculated attempt by cuaron to to get a gig on the potter series. impossible. &quot;princess&quot; was released in 1995, and &quot;sorceror's/philosopher's stone&quot; was published in 1998.this is a small, quiet, sweet little film the entire family can enjoy, without insulting mom &amp; dad's intelligence. it is the next step for all little girls who are starting to outgrow belle/ariel/jasmine and the rest of the animated princesses. this little princess is real, and her story is worth watching.side note-little boys might not find the film engaging. it is kind of chick-flick for the tween set. that doesn't mean it's totally male-unfriendly. fathers of daughters will be hard-pressed to avoid shedding a tear or two.if you have a tween daughter, save some rental money and just buy it! she's going to watch it over and over. 22 of 26 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
