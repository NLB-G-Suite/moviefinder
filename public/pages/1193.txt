if you want to have a career in the army, you might also want to avoid bi-polar women.tommy lee jones (the three burials of melquiades estrada) was an army major, a nuclear engineer working on atomic tests, that had a gorgeous wife who was a little crazy. jessica lange (broken flowers) was awesome as his wife and won every award that year for her performance. she deserved every win in a movie that was a testament to love. no matter how crazy, major marshall (jones) was there for her because of his love. and her love brought her out of her disorder long enough to save him.this was director tony richardson&#39;s last film and he made it a winner all the way. 11 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
