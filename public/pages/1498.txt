is it our own aim of the unknown? what does the white horse represent? who is the mother? then, as well, it can be observed as a criticism of a society fragmented in classes, where corruption is allowed, but body malformation is rejected. a society based on relationships of control, mothers over children, men over women... i feel amazed by the self-confidence of the protagonist, by how she is accepted by children, but rejected by adults. the love story in this movie could represent the inner search for the most authentic in us, which we tend to project outside, like in a mirror. watch it and enjoy it. it is about you, about us, about life. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
