edit did you know? trivia paul w.s. anderson: during the opening dream sequence, a book floats past the camera, featuring a picture of the director and his name. the director himself jokes about this detail in the dvd commentary saying it's his autobiography, title "paul anderson: a life". see more &raquo; goofs when justin is ejected into outer space, his veins immediately start to burst and bleed heavily. this isn't very likely to happen in the short time that he is exposed to the vacuum of space. parts of the body will probably start to bulge due to the lack of atmospheric pressure, and there will probably be some subcutaneous bleeding from ruptured blood vessels, but the human skin is thought to be resilient enough to stay intact. also, the blood that leaves his body remains liquid; in reality, it would boil and evaporate instantly due to the lack of pressure. not everything about the scene is unrealistic: the fact that he remained conscious is probably correct (most adults would remain conscious for 10-20 seconds), as well as the fact that he does not freeze (although deep space is extremely cold, the lack of gas molecules makes it difficult for body heat to leave the body). see more &raquo;

user reviews hell&#39;s horizon 4 february 2009 | by chrysanthepop (fraggle rock) &ndash; see all my reviews &#39;event horizon&#39; is very much an atmospheric sci-fi horror. it does not rely on gore (although there is enough of that) but rather it is the creepy atmosphere that engages the viewer. andersen successfully creates a tense, depressing, and claustrophobic atmosphere. the suspense and pace are well maintained. it pays tribute to several movies of the same genre (like &#39;the shining&#39;, &#39;aliens&#39; etc). character development is slightly weak but the actors do a good job and the viewer cares for them. sam neill, laurence fishburne, kathleen quinlan, joely richardson, richard jones and jason isaacs do a fine job with what they&#39;re given. the sets look very unwelcoming and creepy. the special effects and sound effects are good. the cinematography is superb. the plot is a little complex and difficult to follow in the beginning leaving the viewer wondering with what exactly is going on but this becomes easier with repeated viewings. in my view, &#39;event horizon&#39; is an underrated film and perhaps did not get enough recognition because it did not have any stars or enough &#39;monsters&#39; and &#39;blood&#39; or perhaps the subject was a little too complex for some to grasp. 60 of 79 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
