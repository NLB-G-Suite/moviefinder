frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; boy and animals out shine the adults 14 january 2000 | by f a chang (ontario canada) &ndash; see all my reviews jamie williams, then 12 years old, stars as the man-cub mowgli in this movie adaptation of the classic rudyard kipling story. he is supported by an outstanding cast of animals, such as baloo the bear, baghera the panther, and shere khan the tiger.the story is too well know to bear repeating. but playing against williams are characters representing the yankee &quot;collector&quot; for p. t, barnum's circus (bill campbell), a couple of eccentric british army officers and their wives, an indian hurdy-gurdy player complete with trained monkey, an indian prince who is really mowgli's uncle, and a positively weird tracker with his trained python.there is also an appearance by roddy mcdowall, who was himself a very famous child star (how green was my valley, kidnapped (1948)) with over 158 movie appearances in his career.the boy-cub, his wolf brothers, and all the animals out shine and out star the adults in this movie. the animal trainers are the invisible stars, directing the animals in major roles, not just quick appearances.williams is exceptional in his role as mowgli. i wonder at his stunt abilities. it must be hard to use a body double for a 12 year old boy. see him climb and leap about in trees, run with the animals, dive into rivers, and clamber around on the roof of a moving train.and he's cute, to boot! tanned, smooth skinned, and lithe. with a grin to light up a city. it's a joy to watch him run though the jungle swinging from tree to tree. a young tarzan comes to mind. maybe in a few more years when his body has filled out, williams could replace johnny weismuller?watch this movie as an antidote to the dreadful cartoon version of the novel, with the singing bear. it is an extremely realistic portrayal of a feral boy, his jungle friends, the jungle itself, and those adults who would wish him ill. it belongs in that category of serious movies that star children, but are not just children's stories.this story was not one of kipling's best, in my opinion. it is rather fantastic. for his best story made into a movie, i refer you to &quot;captains courageous&quot; which was filmed in three versions. 11 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 8 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo;
