who are they? the film maker uses the life of one person in central park nyc, maggie cogan, to illuminate us. michael negroponte shows us a life that has made unexpected turns and in the end reveals much more than what we originally thought, a complex story that untangles itself as michael deciphers maggie's mythological life explanations. he also flashes images of his own family life which help us make a transition from our normal existence to that of maggie's. in the end i was left with a sense of understanding and profound melancholy over maggie's plight. 4 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
