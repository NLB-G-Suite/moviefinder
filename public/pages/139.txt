trivia in the supplemental material on the dvd mention is made that there was great camaraderie between most of the actors with the exception of paul lukas. mr. lukas held himself aloof seeming to consider himself too sophisticated to mingle. it may have also been that, because of his age, he was having trouble remembering his lines and was embarrassed. see more &raquo; goofs when the giant squid appears, it is swimming toward the nautilus with its tentacles first. while squid can swim in both directions, they normally move mantle first with tentacles trailing due to much better movement through the water and their gill systems adapted to movement in this direction, particularly if they are trying to swim at a high rate of speed. also, if the squid was moving with the tentacles in front, they would trail toward the back, not stay rigidly in front of it, like a person's arms stretched out. see more &raquo; quotes conseil: i want to escape, too! you said you had a plan. ned land: i do have a plan. trouble is, it won't work. see more &raquo; connections referenced in american masters: james dean: sense memories&nbsp;(2005) see more &raquo; soundtracks toccata and fugue in d minor (uncredited) music by johann sebastian bach played by captain nemo on organ see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: is this the best adaptation on film of a story by jules verne?
