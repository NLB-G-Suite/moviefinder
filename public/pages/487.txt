trivia at the time olivia de havilland rode the palomino, its registered name was "golden cloud" and was owned by hudkins stables, an outfit that leased horses and western equipment for films. roy rogers bought "golden cloud" for $2,500. character actor smiley burnette, who was rogers' sidekick in his early movies, suggested the name of trigger, as the horse was "quick-on-the-trigger". rogers rode trigger in his first starring western, under western stars (1938). see more &raquo; goofs in the final duel, robin pushes guy of gisbourne off the stairs and guy loses his sword which slides down the steps. robin jumps down the side of the stairs and gives guy back his sword, which now is lying at guy's feet. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] town crier announcing capture of richard: news has come from vienna: "leopold of austria has seized king richard on his return from the crusades. our king is being held prisoner. nothing further is known. his highness prince john will make further public pronouncement tomorrow." see more &raquo; crazy credits opening card: "in the year of our lord 1191 when richard, the lion-heart, set forth to drive the infidels from the holy land, he gave the regency of his kingdom to his trusted friend, longchamps, instead of to his treacherous brother, prince john.bitterly resentful, john hoped for some disaster to befall richard so that he, with the help of the norman barons, might seize the throne for himself. and then on a luckless day for the saxons..." see more &raquo; connections referenced in larry king live: episode dated 27 july 1993&nbsp;(1993) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions q: how much sex, violence, and profanity are in this movie?

well, there&#39;s the scene in the great hall at nottingham castle where errol flynn gives cheek to everyone. the escape, the ambush and the final showdown with sir guy of gisborne. (basil rathbone makes a superb villain.) i&#39;m very impressed with the sharpshooting. this was done by howard hill. howard hill appears a few times in the film. in the escape from the great hall he is the only archer among guy of gisburne&#39;s crossbowmen. in the archery tournament scene, he is owen the welshman (in spite of what it says in the credits at the end.) it has been said before, and i&#39;ll say it again: errol flynn did not play robin hood; he is robin hood.performancewise, the cast are superb, with hardly a poor performance among them.i did at one time think that una o&#39;connor was hamming it up a bit. however, i have recently worked in buckinghamshire with a woman with exactly the same accent and - yes - exactly the same laugh. (absolutely true). therefore, una o&#39;connor, who plays marian&#39;s servant who resembles chaucer&#39;s wife of bath, is brilliant! 49 of 63 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 234 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: bishop of the black canons sir essex sir ralf sir mortimer ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
