my favorite bad movie 31 march 2002 | by leona-5 (canada) &ndash; see all my reviews &quot;mad love&quot; isn't one of the all time great films, however it is my favorite bad movie. i think that drew barrymore is charming and this movie allows her to be a little crazy and very beautiful. chris o'donnell is definately eye candy in this little gem. the filmmakers tried to use colour and imagery in an artistic manner. watch the blue and whites of the film, and check out the symbolic use of butterflies. although the usage isn't necessarily intellectual, there is a valient stab at being artistic. i think that another interesting aspect of this film is in comparing it to &quot;scent of a woman&quot;. i feel that these two films are essentially the same, with the notable exception of al pacino vs. drew barrymore. really though, &quot;scent of a woman&quot; has chris as a good boy who goes on the lam with al. al does all sorts of crazy things, such as driving despite being blind, and eventually holds a gun to chris. in &quot;mad love&quot;, chris is a good boy who goes on the lam with drew. drew does all sorts of crazy things, such as covering chris' eyes while he is driving, and eventually holds a gun to chris. coincidence?? 7 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
