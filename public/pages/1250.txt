trivia bruce willis' character gabby (as the cowboy) fires several rounds from a rifle in the desert. this wasn't just any rifle. it was the famous rifle chuck connors' character lucas mccain used in the rifleman, a winchester 44-40 with a 20-inch barrel and the conspicuous backwards, round-d style loop, and the 8-32 set screw tapped through the trigger guard to give the rifle its rapid-fire action that made the rifleman famous and which willis took advantage of in this scene in north. see more &raquo; goofs when the lawyer, arthur bell, meets north for the first time on the street, he hands north his card and promptly takes it back. in the next shot, north is still holding the card. at that point, mr. bell reaches to shake north's hand (which is still holding the card) and in the next shot the card disappears again. see more &raquo; quotes news reporter: arthur belt, the rising politician who drafted the bill... arthur belt: [winchell shuts off the tv] wait! they were talking about me! winchell: relax, arthur, pretty soon you'll be hearing your name so much even you will be sick of it. arthur belt: i highly doubt it. see more &raquo; crazy credits scarlett johansson is credited as scarlett johanssen. her surname is spelt wrong! see more &raquo; connections featured in siskel &amp; ebert &amp; the movies: the client/lassie/it could happen to you/north/barcelona&nbsp;(1994) see more &raquo; soundtracks hawaiian war cta-hu-wa-hu-waii by johnny noble and prince leleiohoku see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews hollywood has reached a new low 3 april 2001 | by willow192 (orlando, florida) &ndash; see all my reviews wow this movie was bad. i heard siskel and ebert slandering it when i was younger...and i was thinking that it couldn't possibly be that bad. well,...i was wrong. elijah wood plays a boy who doesn't like his parents because they don't let him do everything that he wants to. she he decides to take them to court. and the suprising thing is that he actually wins. kids don't get out of their homes when their parents are molesting them, beating them, and neglecting them, and north gets out because his parents don't let him run wild like he doesn't have any? the movie is just lame. maybe it's amusing to 10 year olds who think that parents should let them do whatever they want, but the world just isn't like that. so get over it. the only good thing about this movie...of which many other commentaries have mentioned, was bruce willis in the pink bunny suit. i bet he will never live that down. he's probably looking back on this movie and crying. it was nice to see him in a 'family' movie. 2 out of 10. the 2 points are for the bunny costume. 12 of 19 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
