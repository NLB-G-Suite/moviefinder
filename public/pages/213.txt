as a guy, which i am, i identified with harry's lines so much, and you can't help but side with him. the chemistry between the two actors, billy crystal and meg ryan is superb, and you believe in them when they talk, you feel for them when they look at each other. even the friends are well casted, carrie fisher and bruno kirby. it's such relaxed acting and filming that you do nothing but watch these people fall in love, and pretty soon you feel like you're involved as well. with a fantastic soundtrack, direction, script and acting, it's a great film. 43 of 47 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
