because he's real. it reminds me a bit of the american splendor comics and film where pekar don't have to give a happy ending, a sad ending, clear symbolism, a strong message. just a story even if it does not &quot;fit&quot; into what we expect from books, films, magazines, etc. tom is one of my favorite characters and i still don't understand him and neither do you. this along with everything people have commented on (dialog, editing, characters, etc.) make the film in my opinion one of the greatest films period. what makes godfather better? brando's tired speeches? this is a flick you can watch over and over and i stand by those who respect the genius of this film. so take ya flunkie and dangle and again- this paragraph is for those who give the high hat to tom, the most conflicted and realistic personage in any film i've seen. will you watch tom with amazement or try to analyze his motivation based on film stereotypes?
