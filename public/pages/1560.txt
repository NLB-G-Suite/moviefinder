goofs boom mic visible. several times throughout the film, a boom mic (and even part of the boom) is very clearly visible, mostly in outdoor scenes when the boom was more necessary. this is a masking problem on an early dvd release, and is probably present on any vhs release as well (the dvd is likely transferred from the vhs). the movie was filmed in academy ratio with the intent to mask it to widescreen, in which it was shown in theaters. when telecined to vhs/dvd for home use to watch on your tv set, or perhaps even for tv broadcast, it wasn&#39;t masked: black bars were not placed over the top and bottom to make it letterboxed for widescreen. this was commonly done in pan&amp;scan versions of many theatrical movies for tv broadcast and vhs release so you could get the whole screen without those annoying black bars which would give you a smaller amount of image to squint at. unfortunately, with the whole screen image you also get portions of the image that were not meant to be seen, such as boom mics and track lights on the top and cables and camera dolly tracks and crew-members feet on the bottom. older dvd releases of many movies just copied the full-screen without remasking it, which would require a whole new telecine transfer from the original film source. even some newer dvd releases incorrectly masked some movies, as the bars either weren&#39;t covering enough or were disproportional (covering too much on top and too little on bottom or vice-versa), since the widescreen aspect ratio varies and where you put the masks can vary in a single movie. this is a big controversy, and happens more frequently than you might think; see the 3-dvd release of the back to the future trilogy for a famous example of improper masking. pretty much, whenever you see boom mics visible, it is almost always a masking problem on a video release (tv broadcast or vhs or dvd transfer); it is not the fault of the director or cinematographer or editor. see more &raquo; quotes angela: [thinking she is seeing the devil in front of her, hiding her eyes and praying] mary, full of grace, take away this ugly face. mary, full of grace, take away this ugly face. see more &raquo; connections references mogambo&nbsp;(1953) see more &raquo; soundtracks angel of mercy performed by greta gaines written by greta gaines courtesy of sweat ride music © 1994 see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; lyrical (and eventually disappointing) movie 11 march 2004 | by movie-viewer &ndash; see all my reviews the movie angela, although entertaining in its beginning as a lyrical commentary on the precariousness of childhood, eventually puzzles and disappoints as it declines into david lynch-like lines and imagery that really don't add anything (except perhaps atmosphere) to the film. in the first half of the film, rebecca miller provides us with glimpses and feelings of childhood that trigger vague remembrances of half-forgotten feelings of our own childhood -- the seemingly contradictory juxtaposition of the helplessness of being a non-adult forced to deal with adult problems (e.g., irresponsible or sick parent), with the powerful strength that comes from an ability to believe in worlds that cannot be seen. unfortunately, the second half of the movie degenerates into cryptic dialogue and confusing imagery and scenarios that are reminiscent of lynch at less than his best. mixed in with an increasingly prominent religious-hysteria-in-young-girl story line, the movie just left me feeling annoyed that i'd invested my time in such an unsatisfying film. the main character also began to alienate me, and ultimately cause real antipathy in me, during this second half, where she continues to drag her sister along in her quest for salvation, appropriating other people's property (e.g., horse, family's picture) without compunction because they are &quot;signs&quot; of some holy grail that only she can detect.and although this may seem contradictory to my earlier comment about the cryptic dialogue and imagery, i found the second half to be much too intellectualized. it seems that the filmmaker was trying to tie in the fall of satan/lucifer with the fall that every human must experience in his/her maturation process -- through the realization of one's sexuality (signified by angela's clothing and a particular event), and through the realization of one's own mortality (signified by angela's search for the way to heaven). but i found these efforts to be generally unmoving (perhaps because they were so confused) and thus, as previously stated, ultimately taking away from the enjoyment of the movie. (also, i thought a 10-year-old was a bit too young to illustrate these themes, and the film would have been better off staying away from them altogether.) consequently, the latter half of the movie became a rambling essay on the painful awakenings each child must experience on the road to adulthood, rather than the poem or short story it could have been on the terrible beauty of childhood in an imperfect world. 11 of 17 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 15 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: mae andrew sleepwalker preacher tom darlene man at fair anne anne's mother anne's father frank sam ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
