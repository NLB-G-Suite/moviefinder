see all my reviews this movie is way above so many of the others of its' kind. it's consumately likable, funny, sweet and sharp- the script is a killer, and the acting is fun and enjoyable.part of the success of the film is due to the fact that it appeals to several different audiences, and on multiple levels. i first watched this movie with my mom, who loved the link it has to jane austen's emma- all the main characters and the plot are direct modern equivalents to the novel. for instance, the famous passage in emma inwhich harriet burns all her &quot;mementos&quot; of mr. elton becomes the scene where tai does so infront of cher's gasfire. from this perspective alone, the movie is so fun and sharp to watch- even if your forte isn't usually american teen high school comedy!but this movie works on a really dumbed down scale too- let's face it, not everyone is big on english literature. the movie has an awesome soundtrack, paul rudd is unbelievably cute as &quot;mr knightly&quot; or rather josh- and my boyfriend leads me to believe that the same is true of alicia silverstone- who still sparkles 10 years later as a mid-nineties teen queen with good intentions, cher. her performance here is impossible not to warm too, unless you have some sort of grudge against valley girls, inwhich case you might not like it so much. seriously though, this film is a must see for anyone who likes some real quality comedy- i'm so fond of this film personally that i would suspect basically everyone would enjoy it. 36 of 43 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
