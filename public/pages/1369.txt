a poignant and emotional portrayal of indentured servitude and arranged marriage in turn-of-the-century hawaii. 22 june 2004 | by (ad383) (los angeles, california) &ndash; see all my reviews picture bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been like for japanese men brought to hawaii at the turn of the 19th century to work in the sugar cane fields. most came planning to return to their homeland, but few were ever able to do so. equally movingly portrayed is the fate of japanese women, some as young as fifteen or sixteen, who were sent as promised brides to men they knew only through photographs that often were 10 or 15-years out of date, or were of some other younger man. they too worked long hard hours in the fields, while fighting homesickness and to preserve their dignity.director hatta's portrayal of one picture bride's courage and perseverance struggling to survive in a strange land and alien society under great physical duress, is, ultimately, inspirational and uplifting--a story of moral and cultural survival. there is a grandness and magnificence of sweep of character and landscape in picture bride that captures the alluring beauty as well as violent harshness of colonial hawaii. this is a film that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarding. 22 of 23 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
