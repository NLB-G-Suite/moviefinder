user reviews &nbsp; thrilling thriller 7 february 2006 | by no-skyline (london, england) &ndash; see all my reviews brian de palma delivers a kinetic live wire suspense filled espionage thriller to open the mission impossible franchise. the camera work is exceptional with de palma's trademark sense of motion applied to suspenseful heists and an amazing train ride sequence during which you really get the sense of speed and danger. also created is one of the most iconic images from any thriller of recent times tom cruise suspended mid heist inches from a pressure sensitive floor. cruise lives up to his star billing and for me really nails the ethan hunt character, jean reno, ving rames and the stunning emmanuelle beart provide able support.my one problem with this film and unfortunately quite a big problem is that the twist in the tale can be seen coming a mile off. which is a real shame as this film is inventive, fun, stylish and everything a main stream thriller should be.fun but the twist in the tale doesn't have enough of a sting 7/10 33 of 54 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
