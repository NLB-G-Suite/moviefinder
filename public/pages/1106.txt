edit did you know? trivia in the beginning, a black car rolls into the garage where guy works, and guy is asked to assist with the car's problems. this car is actually roland cassard's and it can be seen two more times: when roland visits the umbrella shop to give ms. emery the money for her pearl necklace, and again as the wedding car. the license plate is the same and can be seen in this latter scene and in the very first. see more &raquo; goofs in act 1, the young couple go to the theater to see the opera carmen. but the sound track that is used in this scene is definitely not from carmen. it is just some stock sound track that sounds vaguely operatic. see more &raquo; quotes madame emery: mr. cassard came this evening. he was sorry he missed you. i'm sure he could give you some advice. geneviève emery: i can do without his advice. madame emery: you're wrong. for me, he is the kind of man... geneviève emery: don't bother me with his kind. madame emery: you look terrible. geneviève emery: leave me alone, mother. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews i saw this movie in 1964 when i was 11 years old. it was my introduction to heartbreaking love and this movie probably influenced my love life or how i imagined love was supposed to be. my mother had to lead me from the theatre when it was over because i was blinded with tears. many years passed until i was able to order the film in vhs and watch it again (about 3 years ago). i still love it. the vivid colors, genevieve and guy's beauty and youth, and the beautiful score by michele legrande combine to transport you to a magical place. i loved the fact that every word was sung, but it was not like opera at all. after a few minutes it was as if every word is always sung and talking doesn't exist. catherine deneuve was so beautiful! i love this movie and highly recommend it. 33 of 34 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
