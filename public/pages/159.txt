user reviews &nbsp; entertaining no brainer 3 november 2005 | by lt_coffey_182 (portsmouth, england) &ndash; see all my reviews top gun is a high quality, visually stunning film that does all it can to take your breath away. it is the excellently choreographed dog fights that remain in the mind longer than anything as they are high octane, dazzling bursts of excitement which bring the film to life. however, fighter jet sequences do not make a film and it is the plot where top gun has some occasional problems.parts of the story are overly cheesy and clich&eacute;d. the proud to be american theme is dire, repetitive and anyone who dislikes over patriotism in films will despise this. the story line involving tom cruise and tom skerrit approaches boredom and is the pinnacle of top gun's cheese. 'cheese' is ok, as long as it is not serious and that is where that specific story line falls flat. the fun cheesy parts are some of the films best moments. the volleyball scene is truly a classic and the four actors involved are genuinely enjoying themselves. the relationship between tom cruise and anthony edwards is also very moving at times and the dynamic they have makes for great viewing.the acting is what saves top gun from being tinsel town garbage. tom cruise launched his career with this film. his cocky smile makes him perfect for this role and cruise does fantastically at portraying a determined, passionate character. it is the emotional scenes where cruise really sets himself apart from his peers. cruise provides the few scenes where the audience are made to feel any emotion and he carries out his responsibility creditably. anthony edwards as goose is also effective as the man who takes second spot to cruise's maverick. he is instantly popular with the audience with his wit, humour and charm. val kilmer and rick rossovich are great as the rivals. they play off each other really well and do a fantastic job to personify arrogance. michael ironside does what he does best and once again, manages to go through a whole film without smiling.the story between cruise and kelly mcgillis is very romantic and sensual. the heat between them is conveyed very well on screen and it is this that sets top gun above films such as iron eagle and chuck norris films.berlin's 'take my breath away' is a song that still gets a good deal of airplay and suits this film to perfection; it's cheesy and its 80s. the music is very effective at setting the mood and complements the feel of the film.top gun is a film that achieves its objectives, to entertain. if you're looking for intelligent writing or mass thought provocation, this film isn't for you. top gun is best suited to those who desire to switch off their brain and enjoy. 47 of 64 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 396 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
