user reviews &nbsp; one of adam sandler&#39;s best 1 october 2007 | by vince200002000 (united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews as a comedian, adam sandler does great on all of his comedy films but this one will always stand as one of his best most funniest films. the plot is very ridiculous, but in a way that makes it truly hilarious. billy madison must go back to school in order to prove that he is responsible and mature enough to take over his fathers hotel business. the fact that billy is totally incapable of running a hotel, and can be a total idiot at times makes the whole idea of it so funny. all of the other characters are funny in their own unique ways. this movie will always have a special shine as one of the funniest movies of the 90&#39;s and one of sandler&#39;s best in his career. 15 of 27 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
