user reviews &nbsp; pretty good film for a rainy day 2 july 2000 | by tobys (atlanta) &ndash; see all my reviews mary reilly is a great film to watch on a rainy afternoon. often criticized as boring and a low point in julia roberts career, i found it to be a great gothic story. while i can understand and see why people were put to sleep by the film, i think it's a refreshing change of pace from the standard popcorn flick that is only interested in being the number 1 film at the box office monday morning. john malkovich turns in a great performance of the jekyll/hyde character, and glenn close steals the few scenes she's in as a madame of a brothel. julia roberts plays against type as a dour chambermaid, and i think that's what put off so many people. obviously, most people like their julia flashing her now $20 million dollar smile. i say, &quot;good for you for trying something different.&quot; if you haven't seen mary reilly, watch it on the next rainy day and enjoy it. my grade: 8 out of 10 12 of 13 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 98 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
