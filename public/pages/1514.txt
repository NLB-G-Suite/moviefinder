see all my reviews i&#x27;m surprised this wasn&#x27;t a made for tv film! it has the look of a tv production, it was most likely video taped. the writing and direction is not up to movie standards. while they do have some veteran actors; they performances were tainted by poor writing. the writer decided that rather then rely on well written story with just a few of the points he wanted to make; he decided to throw every racism clich&#xe9; into this one. and while the story is just plain silly; the poor direction leads to some pretty poor performances. i&#x27;m sure many of the actors in this film don&#x27;t list this as one they are proud of. we all know that there are abuses by law enforcement; but this writer/director is beating us over the head with this script. if your looking for a well written, well acted story that make you feel like you got your monies worth; avoid this film like the plague. written at about a 4th grade level. 5 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
