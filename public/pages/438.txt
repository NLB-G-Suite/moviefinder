frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; as bad as expected! 23 january 2008 | by mario_c (porto, portugal) &ndash; see all my reviews it&#39;s a cheap production sequel to amityville series that has almost nothing to do with the original movie (or even the story!). the kind of plot used is the same which have been used so many times before. the production is much worse than the previous films (at least comparing with the first two movies). the soundtrack is very different too and it&#39;s terrible (it&#39;s between very poor pseudo-mysterious sounds and a cheap imitation of psycho&#39;s tube scene track). but if the production and the soundtrack are really bad, the acting is not better; especially the performance of dawna wightman (who plays debbie). it&#39;s incredibly awful! is she a professional actress? i really don&#39;t think so! anyway, this chapter doesn&#39;t add anything new to the series and it would be totally unnecessary! 3 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
