trivia the scene with the water tentacle coming up through the moon pool was written so that it could be removed without interfering with the story, because no one knew how the effect would come out. the actors were interacting with a length of heater hose being held up by the crewmen. when the effects were completed, though, they exceeded everyone's expectations and wildest hopes, paving the way for increased use of computer-generated special effects in films. see more &raquo; goofs when they find the montana, it looks like it's tilted (banked) to one side by about 50 degrees or so. a few shots later, it looks more like 70 or 80 degrees, and in the interior shots it looks more like 20 or 30 degrees. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] uss montana captain: sixty knots?
