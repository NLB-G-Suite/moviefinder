it's a real shame he never lived to see its success because he deserved to.it's hard to find the right words to surmise this film; i suppose i could break each section down and give my opinion as others have done, but as a whole - well, it's got good bits and bad bits; happy and sad bits, it's scary and funny and gloomy and sunny. it's spirited, colourful, sparkling, animated... but let's not get carried away here. it's only a film and some bits of it are quite boring.if you randomly wound through it you could find yourself watching any one of the above, and this to me sums it up - it's unique. what other film can you say that about?fantasia is a light that will shine for generations to come. 9/10. 18 of 26 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
