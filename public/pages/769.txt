user reviews what a f@*%#d up freakin' movie! 9 october 2004 | by bighardcorered (calimesa, california) &ndash; see all my reviews i didn't have high expectations for this movie and it started off slow, but this turned into a pretty messed up movie. not messed up in a deliverance or vulgar type of homosexual rape way but messed up as far as how the creature in the film is created, how come the creature is created, and how the creature kills others. some pretty gory scenes featuring nudity with gore, dismemberment and mutilation for those who are into that sort of thing.the movie had a low budget feel to it, which many horror/gore fans are into, but regardless, the creature looked pretty realistic and disfigured. my complaint with the creature is that when you are disfigured, handicapped and starved nearly to death, that would weaken you. it seemed to make this a superhuman disfigured person who can jump out of second story windows and still run to catch up to it's victim. he wouldn't be so quiet either, at least in his case.it took nearly an hour for the movie to fully get going with the horror after the build up, but it turned into a pretty decent effort. i didn't even rent this movie, it came as a special feature to deathbed on the dvd, and felt this movie was far better than the one they actually featured. i give this movie 7 of 10 stars. 19 of 27 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
