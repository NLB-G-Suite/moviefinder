see all my reviews i have reviewed this film several times, and find new details i missed. how did they film this, and using non-professional actors, as well? mysterious, magical, educational, and dazzling to the eye and ear. seems much careful planning went into this production, a labor of love. the dali lama, must be grateful his story, can now reach the world and his personal mission, may be recognized and possible fulfilled in his lifetime?like the &quot;last emperor&quot; and &quot;little buddha&quot; this &quot;slice of the metaphysical river&quot;, is breathtaking in its visual beauty. a story that grabs your heart and soul, and you find yourself, thinking about it weeks later.now i have a &quot;free tibet&quot; sticker on my pathfinder, out of reverence for this tiny country, raped by the political powers in control of china.bravo to the cast, and film crews. 27 of 31 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
