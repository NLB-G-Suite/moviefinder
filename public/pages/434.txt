user reviews &nbsp; i thought this amityville was full of cheesy fun. 12 may 2009 | by aaron1375 &ndash; see all my reviews there must have been a law in the 1980&#x27;s that stated that if you are to make a third film to a set of horror movies you must make them in 3-d as this was one of them, along with other such fine films as jaws 3-d and friday the 13th part iii in 3-d. sad to say, but i enjoyed all these movies even though i know in my heart of heart they were all bad movies. however, just because a movie is bad does not make it non-entertaining. well at least to me it does not...perhaps to a more mainstream viewer, i admit i am a little more offbeat than most people to say the least. this story has a guy moving into the amityville house for whatever reasons after he proves this one little group of people are fake psychics. through a series of events though he begins to find out just how real the horrors are in the house that has had cast evil upon all those who lived there. i have to say the movie is not as graphic as the second movie, but it has a lot more to it than the first movie in the ways of scares and such and it has a nice conclusion too. still the movie has to many 3-d moments too to be a really good movie. you know the scenes, pointless scenes where they aim something directly at the camera and such. still, the movie runs at a fast clip and is entertaining to watch, plus you get to see a young meg ryan in one of her first roles. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
