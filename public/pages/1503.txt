see all my reviews i watched this movie with friends and we laughed the whole way through. this would be fine, if the movie was a comedy, but instead its a bland and ultimately forgettable childrens flick. you can tell that ryan only got the part because he was christian slaters brother, as he hams up the screen throughout its entirety. ling is certainly no better, her fake asian accent is pathetic, as is her acting ability. i realize they are only kids but there have been good child actors before, and these two aren't up to scratch. the real star of the show is the panda, it shows character throughout, especially in the scene when it attacks ryan on the bridge. this of course excludes the scenes in which it is played by a robot, did the director actually think that thing looked like a real panda? overall this film is bad, but watchable family material. the kids will probably love it, but there are better films around. rehire e.t., the goonies, or even toy story, these films are more sincere and watchable then this movie, and will actually be remembered in time to come. 1 of 5 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
