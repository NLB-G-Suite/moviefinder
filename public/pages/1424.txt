see all my reviews angelina jolie in a role showing a charming sweetness to an even higher degree than in 'playing by heart'. the courtship plays out against a somewhat contrived background of italian family rivalry, somewhat reminiscent of romeo and juliet, but with a hollywood happy end, even though with heavy handed ethnicity thrown in. if this movie was available on dvd i would buy it in a new york minute ;-). fun entertainment for the whole family. no doubt i am prejudiced since i really like angelina, but then what's not to like about her (forget about her personal life)? charming. 4 of 7 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
