edit storyline as the title suggests, this dramatised documentary about the eccentric canadian pianist glenn gould is broken up into thirty-two short films (mirroring the thirty-two part structure of bach's 'goldberg variations', the recording that gould made famous), each giving us an insight into some aspect of gould's life and career. out of respect for the music lead actor colm feore is never seen playing the piano, merely reacting to gould's own recordings, which are extensively featured written by michael brooke &lt;michael@everyman.demon.co.uk&gt;

quotes [first lines] glenn gould: [voiceover] my mother tells me that by five years old i had decided definitively to become a concert pianist. i think she had decided some time earlier. the story goes that while i was in the womb she played the piano continuously to give me a head start, and evidently it paid off. my mother was my first teacher, and i've never doubted her methods. after all, she introduced me to bach. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews i saw this on dvd and enjoyed it thoroughly. the means of portraying a person - through short and disconnected vignettes - was surprisingly natural. when you think about it, this is often how we learn about people: a collection of stories, incidents, things their friends say about them, memories from childhood. not only that, but it nicely parallels some of the music, such as the short pieces in bach's well-tempered klavier. each has a different mood, but together they paint a complete picture. this movie is a lot of fun for anyone who is fond of classical music and willing to experiment a little bit with film. 7 of 11 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
