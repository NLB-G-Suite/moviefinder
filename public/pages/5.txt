18 february 2002 | by baronbl00d (baronbl00d@aol.com) (nc) &ndash; see all my reviews definitely a film that will have you on the edge of your seat, if not hugging it as closely as possible. copycat tells the story of a serial killer psychologist(wonderfully played by sigourney weaver), slowly working her way from phobias due to an attack from a serial killer, working with the law(serviceably played by a cute holly hunter) in search of a serial killer that kills in the previous styles of former serial killers. the murderer uses old photos and the books of weaver to recapture the &quot;essence&quot; of each brutal killing. murders are done ala albert desalvo, son of sam, ted bundy, jeffrey dahmer, and others. the film is very fascinating and yet very twisted too. the killer is played with such conviction by william mcnamara. another killer in prison(the one that attacked weaver) is played with unusual repulsivenes by harry connick jr. the real star here is the script which has unusual intelligence for such subject matter. there is a good deal of violence, yet a subtle humour pervades much of the discussion between the cops and even weaver and hunter in a few scenes. but the thrill aspect of the film...the raw suspense...steers the picture from beginning to end. hunter and weaver(particularly) do incredible jobs in their roles, and i was impressed with the film as a whole. 24 of 29 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
