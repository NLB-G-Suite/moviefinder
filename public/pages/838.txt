trivia before finally settling on a studio, al pacino's final choices were miramax films and fox searchlight. harvey weinstein who had seen the film in its rawest footage, loved the film and really wanted it badly. pacino chose fox because tom rothman who was the then head of fox searchlight loved the film as well and oversaw the project until he was promoted to the head of the studio. it was a decision that pacino regretted as he was left alone without any basic help as the studio's new regime was forming into place. see more &raquo; goofs in discussion, pacino and co. are studying the &quot;*g* of edward's heirs the murderer shall be,&quot; and decide, since it's supposed to refer to clarence, that they'll change it to &quot;'c&quot; of edward's heir's.&quot; the problem is, the prophecy very deliberately refers to richard, duke of gloucester and clarence, duke of george. with &quot;g&quot; the prophecy is true. if you change it to &quot;c&quot; the prophecy becomes false, and can no longer refer to two people. see more &raquo; quotes al pacino: a person has an opinion. it's only an opinion. it's never a question of right or wrong. see more &raquo; connections version of masterpiece playhouse: richard iii&nbsp;(1950) see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews great great great 27 march 2001 | by caspian1978 (boston, ma) &ndash; see all my reviews who would have thought that an italian from new york city could play richard the 3rd. ? al pacino is marvellous as he searches the stage and beyond for the true richard the 3rd. kevin spacey, winonna ryder, and alex baldwin are just some who join him in the journey as he wonders the streets of new york and london for the true love of shakespeare. 13 of 14 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
