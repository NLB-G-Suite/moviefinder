it&#x27;s entertaining to watch, but awkward to behold at this point of the story.that the motion-capture, for all of its beauty and detail in the faces and people and locations and dazzling set-pieces, doesn&#x27;t engage on a purely spiritual level (not even to the extent that &#x27;muppet christmas&#x27; did, that at least had the ghost of henson on the production to keep things truly haunting), is somewhat forgivable for what zemeckis does accomplish here. he puts a modern spin on a classic tale, makes it approximately dark and mostly uncompromising for all ages- adults will jump possibly more than the kids at the whoa effects- and jim carrey is nothing short of astonishing.carrey plays scrooge in such a bravura way that only calls attention to itself as a dramatic part (only toward the end, when he becomes &#x22;happy&#x22; scrooge are there a few unintentional laughs), and it may even be the best scrooge seen in many years in any medium. added to this are his *other* parts in the film, as the ghosts of christmas past and present, the former creepy just on the pronunciation of &#x27;s&#x27;. others like gary oldman and colin firth come off more or less fine if not remarkable (oldman as marley is fantastic - as cratchit, a oldman-faced hobbit, is another thing). 41 of 61 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
