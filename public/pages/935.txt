(tip: spend the extra money to get the criterion dvd disc. it is the only clear, sharp copy of this film i have seen.)the story&#x27;s strength lies in getting the viewer involved. one never knows whether gary grant is a good guy or a bad guy. the dialog between grant and hepburn is very entertaining as the latter tries to figure out the same thing. there are lots of good lines, particularly by grant. that in itself makes this film fun to watch multiple times. the pacing of this story also is good; the film moves fast and spaces the action out smartly.this has to be one of the best movies ever to come out of the 1960s. i have never known anyone who didn&#x27;t like this film. 69 of 85 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 269 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: insp. edouard grandpierre mr. felix ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
