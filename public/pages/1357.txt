see all my reviews i don't really understand why this film hasn't done better--either on this site, with the public, or in the theatres. i've never seen eric shaeffer's studio films, but this indie was obviously made by someone with total artistic control over the piece, and it's all the better for it. shaeffer avoids the usual traps of a writer/director/star--he's got talent in each of these areas, and isn't simply on an ego trip. it's a great film for anyone who likes to see a curiously mismatched, strangely well-matched couple meet each other on-screen. i wouldn't call it a romantic comedy, but i would call it extremely romantic (without being sentimental) and funny (in a nice, dry way). the connection and chemistry between shaeffer and his co-star is evident from the first. i found the writing crisp, the storyline well planned and not predictable, and the character development deft. among its many strong points is the perfect pacing of the piece, and the fact that the person in the film who is supposed to be such a good writer actually is. you understand why the writing read in the film (in voiceover) has the effect it does on the characters. if you can find it, rent it. 11 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
