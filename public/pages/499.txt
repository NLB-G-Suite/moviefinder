trivia "the candidate" was one of a handful of 1972 warner bros. releases to feature a rare, short-lived version of the wb shield logo, with a solid blue background and "a warner communications company" tagline (wci had just become warners' parent company, but the familiar '70s era saul bass logo had not yet been designed). "deliverance" was the only other high-profile wb movie to use this logo. see more &raquo; goofs (at 51:00) when david opens the door to the office bill and marvin are in. see more &raquo; quotes floyd j. starkey: i think you'll find we have a lot in common. bill mckay: i don't think we have shit in common. see more &raquo; connections referenced in hang time: the candidate&nbsp;(1995) see more &raquo; soundtracks a better way music by john rubinstein lyrics by david colloff see more &raquo; frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; the timeless definitive campaign 24 june 2001 | by jlacerra (philadelphia, pa) &ndash; see all my reviews this is a truly excellent and overlooked redford vehicle, and his performance comes full circle. from wide-eyed idealism to resigned cynicism, all the way back to little-boy-lost and overwhelmed. redford is flawless! peter boyle is right-on as the experienced campaign hand. also it is easy to overlook don porter's effortless portrayal of the smooth and experienced incumbent senator, just on the verge of decline. porter's seamless delivery makes it look easy.douglas is also excellent as john j. mckay, redford's father and the former governor. obviously a traditional machine politician, and apparently estranged from his activist son for that, and perhaps for other reasons we are left to imagine, douglas revels in the younger man's initiation to the corrupt world of politics. catch the hunting scene to illustrate how these two are poles apart.an intelligent, realistic, and rewarding film about politics, done at a time when folks were perhaps looking for a political fairy tale. 14 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 65 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: marvin lucas john j. mckay senator crocker jarmon klein nancy mckay rick jenkin wally henderson paul corliss floyd j. starkey david neil atkinson lynn pilot station manager ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
