see all my reviews here&#39;s a movie that knows its place and doesn&#39;t kid itself in trying to think it&#39;s anything intelligent or well-written. &quot;solo&quot; simply wants to be a fun action movie, and it succeeds. looking a lot like 2005&#39;s &quot;stealth,&quot; only with lesser special effects, &quot;solo&quot; (made almost a decade before &quot;stealth&quot;) is a one-man army movie to the extreme. it stars mario van peebles (remember him?) as solo, an android built by the army that goes renegade and helps a group of farmers save their village. but the army wants their billion dollar project back, and will stop at nothing to get it! i enjoyed &quot;solo&quot; on the grounds that you don&#39;t have to think very hard, and yet it still entertains. mario van peebles does a fine job as the android, and i also noticed adrien brody as his programmer. &quot;solo&quot; was bashed mainly because it was years behind its time. had it been released the same year as &quot;rambo,&quot; it may have found a wider audience. but if you like action and don&#39;t want things like plot or character development to get in the way, see &quot;solo.&quot; it&#39;s a good action movie, and a fun 90 minutes. 7 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 44 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo;
