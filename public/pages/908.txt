see all my reviews i was hesitant to see this movie for the longest time. nicolas cage and meg ryan in a romantic drama would seem to spell a movie filled with forlorn looks and sweet nothings whispered to each other. upon seeing it, this movie proved my suspicions true.however, i was astonished at how much more this film had. the sheer amount of interesting concepts, combined with the ability to look at humanity from some distance, made this movie well worth the watch. if this film succeeds, and i believe it does, it is precisely because of the mixture of hollywood gloss and original wenders magic. something for everyone, if only you give it a little thought.touching date movie, nice discussion piece, and filled with attractive people, city of angels is wonderfully shallow and surprisingly deep at times, making it well worth the watch. 22 of 34 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
