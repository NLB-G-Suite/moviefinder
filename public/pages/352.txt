see all my reviews &quot;the client&quot; is an enjoyable and well executed thriller overall. while the directing, script and overall product are far from amazing and sometimes quite bland, the oscar level performances compensate for the easily over-seeable flaws. perhaps the child of the title, brad renfro, can be annoying in parts he gives a decent enough performance nonetheless. too bad about the drinks and drugs problem he has today. susan sarandon gives another terrific performance, this time as an alcoholic lawyer. tommy lee jones' character doesn't have much to do with the plot but he's a welcome addition to the film, even though. while it is easy to find fault with the film it's easier to just sit back and enjoy it. i chose the latter so i thought it was a good, if not spectacular movie overall. 6.8/10. 12 of 19 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
