actually quite good 21 october 2005 | by lee eisenberg (lee.eisenberg.pdx@gmail.com) (portland, oregon, usa) &ndash; see all my reviews one of those &quot;slice of life&quot; stories, &quot;mixed nuts&quot; portrays several hours on christmas eve in a crisis hot-line center where phil (steve martin) works. over the day, a most unusual series of events happens, and no one's life will ever be the same again. some of the scenes are real shockers (you'll know them when you see them).steve martin has a great time with the role, as does rita wilson as catherine o'shaughnessy, phil's co-worker. you'll really like the elevator scene. great support from madeline kahn, robert klein, juliette lewis, anthony lapaglia, rob reiner, adam sandler, and liev schreiber make this movie truly one christmas treat. jon stewart and parker posey also appear. 9 of 12 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
