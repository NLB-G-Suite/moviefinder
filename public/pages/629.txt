quotes [first lines] dr. george waggner: repression. repression is the father of neurosis, of self-hatred. now, stress results when we fight against our impulses. we've all heard people talk about animal magnetism, the natural man. the noble savage, as if we'd lost something valuable in our long evolution into civilized human beings. now there's a good reason for this. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews terrific modern werewolf film from director joe dante remains one of his best movies.news anchor has a terrifying encounter with a lunatic murderer, then decides to seek rest in an isolated colony of weird characters. it's about to become a hairy situation!writer john sayles (who does a humorous cameo as a morgue attendant) makes the howling a clever and deeply spooky picture with some nicely tongue-in-cheek humor. the story references lots of old-school horror movies, notice how many of the characters in this movie are named after directors of old werewolf films. dante lends some well-crafted direction, giving the movie a truly haunting atmosphere. he builds some great suspense and the occasional good shock. the art direction by robert burns is also quite good, making for some creepy settings. rob bottin's makeup fx are impressive and frightening. pino donaggio's music score is splendidly dramatic.dee wallace stone does a strong performance as the film's troubled heroine. patrick macnee, dennis dugan, belinda balaski, and christoper stone are also good in their supporting roles. elisabeth brooks and robert picardo make for some truly scary villains.along with landis's great american werewolf in london, which ironically came out the same year as this film, the howling ranks as one of the very best modern werewolf movies!**** out of **** 22 of 27 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
