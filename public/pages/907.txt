killed by its own premise 13 january 2007 | by jic-1 (camberley, england) &ndash; see all my reviews this movie has one huge problem: *its basic premise makes no sense at all*. killing the kid is in absolutely nobody&#39;s interest. his codebreaking skill would be of immeasurable value to the very people who are trying to kill him, while safeguarding the code without killing him would be fairly straightforward. this is so obvious that it essentially ruins the whole movie.the rest of the movie is ok if you ignore that problem. the performances are generally good, and miko hughes is excellent as simon. there is nothing here you haven&#39;t seen a dozen times before, but it&#39;s generally well done. it&#39;s not worth making any real effort to see this movie, but you probably won&#39;t have a bad time if you do. 36 of 59 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
