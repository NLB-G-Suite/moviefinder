frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; beautiful movie 3 may 2006 | by laura (guingel@mac.com) (new york) &ndash; see all my reviews this is one of the most visually appealing movies i have ever seen. i love the style. it&#39;s very rich, with lots of rich colors and elegant scenarios and beautiful foods, but at the same time sort of spare, due to the severe landscapes and settings. makes for a beautiful contrast. the actors also add to the visual appeal, they fit the look of the movie very well, have the same sort of unusual aestheticism.the story is also an engrossing one, with a fulfilling and fascinating love story. personally, i&#39;m not that fond of the parts where the film gets figurative or symbolic, i just have a hard time getting meaning out of it--but it isn&#39;t too ambiguous, and the style of the film certainly makes it well worth a little confusion.it&#39;s also very interesting to get to see georgia, which provides an interesting perspective on some of the political events shown in the film. it&#39;s an unusual setting, very cool.i just love to look at this movie. it&#39;s really beautiful. and the food always looks amazing. overall, charming. 5 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
