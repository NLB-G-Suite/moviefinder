should have been a lot better.... 29 november 1999 | by meredith-7 (melbourne, australia) &ndash; see all my reviews you would expect that when the comic talents of robin williams and billy crystal are combined the results would be fairly amusing...unfortunately they are not. this is another failed attempt by hollywood to americanize a french movie which is everything that this film is not. one of the biggest problems with this film is that the boy is so unlikeable - probably a fault of both the script and the actor. you can't believe that anyone would care that this little idiot ran away from home, and that two people were desperate enough to be his father to chase after him. julia louis-dreyfuss &amp; nastassja kinski have very little to do in their respective roles, especially kinski, whose role is more of a cameo than a role of any substance. the entire setting and story behind the boys disappearance is ridiculous, as is the sub-plot involving kinski's husband trying to find the boy as well. the leads are just not up to scratch compared to their usual comic abilities. a real let down, and a total waste of time. 5 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
