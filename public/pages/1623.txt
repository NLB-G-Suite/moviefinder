see all my reviews if you think that you know the answer, just watch this masterpiece by the patriarch of the italian &quot;new generation&quot; whose work has changed the history of the italian cinema (and literature). a marvellous poetic, neorealistic look on the pure maternal love and its interaction with the rotten feelings of the real world. the movie has the expressional force of a greek tragedy, describing the impuissance of ordinary people to alter their fate by believing that &quot;life is so beautiful, if you can think wisely&quot;. 12 of 17 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
