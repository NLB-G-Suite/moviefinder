user reviews &nbsp; enjoyable musical 25 december 2006 | by claudio carvalho (rio de janeiro, brazil) &ndash; see all my reviews the bookshop salesgirl jo stockton (audrey hepburn) is accidentally found by the photograph dick avery (fred astaire), who convinces the owner of the fashion magazine quality, the powerful maggie prescott (kay thompson), that she could be the new model she wants for the magazine. jo dreams on going to paris to meet her guru, the philosopher prof. emile flostre (michel auclair), but she cannot afford to pay for the travel; therefore she sees in the invitation, the chance to visit paris. once there, dick falls in love for her.&quot;funny face&quot; has a great cinematography, art direction, set decoration, costume design and most important, a charming and delightful audrey hepburn. kay thompson is also excellent. the problem is the silly screenplay that shows at least two great mistakes. the first one is the inconsistent and contradictory character jo stockton, presented as an intelligent and clever woman in the beginning, but later becoming absolutely shallow, acting like an irresponsible spoiled child. the second big mistake is fred astaire (58), thirty years old older than audrey hepburn (28), therefore more than twice her age, as her romantic pair. this great actor looks like her father, and there is no romantic chemistry between them. my vote is seven.title (brazil): &quot;cinderela em paris&quot;
