edit storyline a man accused of murdering his wife approaches a hotshot female criminal attorney to take his case. the man is a self-professed womaniser, and his alleged motive would be the large sum of money his wife left him. the attorney begins to have second thoughts about representing him when he starts making it look like they're having an affair and tells her things she can't reveal because of lawyer/client privilege, so she starts her own investigation of him, which threatens her career and the safety of her friends and herself. written by ed sutton &lt;esutton@mindspring.com&gt;

lumet delivers again, thanks to a sinister star sinning role 1 november 2014 | by videorama-759-859391 (adelaide, australia) &ndash; see all my reviews what makes guilty of sin so much fun, lies in it&#x27;s title. we wanna believe the bad guy, johnson, who we believe is pretty much guilty from the start, the movie&#x27;s title, a strong inference, so you really can&#x27;t call it a thriller. johnson has always been an underestimated or underrated actor in my opinion, who never grade of a list, but has given so many good performances. only here as a sexy, slimy, smarmy, narcissistic, son of a bitch who is as the title refers, he&#x27;s exceptionally good, while de mornay, defending him, isn&#x27;t too bad. she falls for him, of course, despite the fact she&#x27;s already involved. she soon realizes, this is her downfall, and by now he&#x27;s pretty much soon he&#x27;s got her, making her shake and cringe. soon people around her are getting hurt, and the game becomes more violent. i&#x27;ve never enjoyed watching don johnson more, than in this, it&#x27;s cool finale making you wanna jump up and clap. despite the movie being a tad dry, with a kind of slow moving story, the latter really doesn&#x27;t affect the film, thanks to bad guy johnson and all the effectively tense and truly scary moments he delivers, in his performance, where sinning never looked better. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
