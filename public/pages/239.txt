(it is very similar to the film ponnette) but what i considered to be the best part of this movie was the little boy's performance. the kid is just the best kid actor i have seen in a long while. his acting not only is fabulous but really touching and convincing.i highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a well made european movie that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. 24 of 29 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 64 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: klára broz mother houdek nadezda blanka tamara musil pasa brozová pokorný novotný bustiková ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
