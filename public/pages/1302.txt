see all my reviews having seen a country life, another film based on chekhov's uncle vanya, i have to say i preferred august. while both of them have taken the story to another setting and another time, i was swayed by the compelling performance of anthony hopkins (and perhaps his direction, too). kate burton was beautiful and enigmatic, and i couldn't help but see glimpses of her famous father slipping through, after just viewing becket the night before. august had all the elements of chekhovian drama: unfulfilled dreams, boredom, longing for an elusive future. the entire cast was magnificent, and hopkins was amazing as usual. he brought so much to the role -the finest actor today! 16 of 20 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
