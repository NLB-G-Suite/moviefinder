'basic instinct' is in the latter category. it is so erotic and stone and douglas have so much sexual chemistry that when you look at an adrian lyne film, you see them for the crap they are.basic plotline has stone's character, 'catherine tramell', accused of the vicious sex murder of a retired rock and roll star. douglas's character has a strange attraction to her, which may not lead to good things..... paul verhoven has openly admitted that this film is a homage to alfred hitchcock's classic masterpiece 'vertigo'. in fact, stone wears, in sequence, the same wardrobe as kim novak did [which makes you wonder, was she wearing panties under her clothes]. that brings us to the interrogation scene, which is the best in the movie. stone shamelessly flirts with the cops' libidos until the buildup of sexual tension is so great, stone releases it by playing 'peek-a-boo' with the space in between her legs. every male viewer cherishes that scene, simply because it is so sexy. that word can be used throughout the film, as stone and douglas do the mattress mumbo. at the time, the sex scenes were so realistic that the press went wild and debated whether or not viewers were witnessing un-simulated sex. the film is still quite sexually daring today and has an intriguing spider's web plot too. the plot's twists and turns manage to make the movie sexier as the viewer wonders whether sharon is innocent or guilty..........the film's only misstep occurs at the end, with an unsatisfactory ending that makes the whole film seem like some stupid, contrived game. but it's not. it keeps it's fascination and it's sexiness and its suspense right up till the end, which is what a good erotic thriller should. actually, the ending for some will lead to a lot of discussion if you watch the film with someone, as the film toys with two of the film's characters innocence or guilt and does not give up all its secrets.....the film is great verhoeven. it has his usual, hilarious, seemingly inappropriate kinky humor and extreme sex and violence to match. the fact that verhoeven is actually able to balance the film and make it funny and sexy is wonderful film-making. well, have i said 'sexy' enough times? then go rent it.........8/10p.s. if you like this one, check out verhoevens' dutch film ''the fourth man''. it has a similar plot and even a similar character that resembles catherine tramell. if the ending of 'basic instinct' leaves you wanting, check that film out. it is even better than 'basic' and is more 'arty'. it is also a little bit more daring erotically. 57 of 77 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 303 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: dr. lamott ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
