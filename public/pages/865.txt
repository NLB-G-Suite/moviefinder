see all my reviews as a filmmaker john cassavetes was always challenging his audience. he wanted to shake people out of their traditional patterns of the way people watch movies. he wanted to constanly stay one step ahead of viewers and challenge them to keep up. if you know this, any cassavetes movie is a rewarding viewing experience. if you are unaware of this, you will surely be lost like so many reviewers i've read here are. she's so lovely is nick cassavetes paying tribute to his father's unique and often misunderstood style. the characters, like real people, do not know what they are going to do from one moment to the next. this is what makes the movie so funny, unpredictable - and so honest and true to life - that it makes some uncomfortable. alot of critics have stated that it is unrealistic that a mother would ever leave her family under the circumstances presented here, but until you've been in a similar situation how can you really say? at any rate, one thing you can never accuse this movie of being is predictable. john cassavetes often recut his movies even when people liked them. if he were still alive, he would probably be delighted to read all the negative reviews here, because they all point to one thing: cassavettes has done it again. he has shaken people out of their set ways of watching movies and no one seems to be hip to it - yet. like any great jazz artist, the work of john cassavetes may be misunderstood at first, but finds it's audience eventually. he is somewhere laughing, knowing he has done his job. if you don't agree, keep this review in mind and watch this movie again/for the first time. like all of his films, she's so lovely improves with repeat viewings. 15 of 24 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
