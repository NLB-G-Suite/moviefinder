user reviews one of seagal's finest 22 july 2000 | by (w.w.screwface) (london england) &ndash; see all my reviews i cannot believe this film got such bad ratings as it is one of my favourite action flicks of all time. marked for death has steven seagal playing john hatcher a cop whose out for revenge against a gang of jamaican drug dealers. the film has some terrific action sequences and set pieces, example being the shopping centre fight which really showcases seagal's talents. this has excellent pacing as well as good location shoots. the score for marked for death is amazing, suiting the film so well, giving it the right sinister kind of atmosphere. the voodoo elements were cool, screwface has to be one of the best villains and the twist at the end is unexpected. the violence in the uncut version is some of the most brutally realistic you can find in a mainstream action flick, with seagal snapping bones as if they were twigs. be warned though, like most of seagal's films, in the u.k marked for death was cut badly by the censors so nearly all of the bone breaking violence is now gone, leaving just a standard badly edited action film. if you want to see the real power of marked for death then you would be advised get your hands on the uncut versions somehow. the only minor flaw with this film is that the beginning in mexico is a little ropey, but apart from that the only seagal flick that warner bros didn't make but fox did, deserves a place next to under seige 2 as being one of my favourite steven seagal films. 14 of 19 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
