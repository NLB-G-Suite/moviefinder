(should have gotten shaq for the part).... 6) no actor to actor chemistry ever formed. 7) the final scenes completely missed out on the dramas of the &quot;standing still&quot; time and the alien departure. what message did he leave us with? since i&#39;m a poor typist and can&#39;t immediately recall all of my issues with the film, i&#39;ll end my comments by saying that i have no problem with changing a remake so that it is more up to date and offers some different twists to add interest. however, this film completely missed the mark of maintaining the strengths that the original script had, namely convincing acting with consistent story and character build-up leading to a dramatic final scene with a clear message to all of the world.they could and should have done far far better. 215 of 340 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 699 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
