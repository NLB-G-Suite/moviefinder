frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; if you like this movie, then you should try.... 22 december 2004 | by chunkymonkey24 (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews if you liked this movie, then you should try william wyler's &quot;the heiress&quot; (1949) featuring gwtw's melanie, olivia de havilland and montgomery clift. both of these movies contain moving performances from all of the lead actors. catherine sloper is skillfully portrayed as an unworldly, naive, young woman who falls for financially-unmatched, well-cultured, dashing morris townsend. the overprotective yet unloving dr. austin sloper, catherine's father, will make your blood boil! both movies have the making for some intense soap opera-like drama - suspenseful in every regard, keeps you reaching for that bowl of popcorn or that box of kleenex. to truly understand the plight of the young lovers and especially to get a sense of the tension behind the relationship between daughter and father, one must view &quot;the heiress&quot; and &quot;washington square&quot; for the two films are lovely by themselves, but they certainly complement each other. you'll see what i mean after watching both ;) enjoy! 12 of 17 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
