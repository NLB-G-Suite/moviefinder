see all my reviews despite this film getting its title from neil sedaka&#x27;s hit song from the early sixties, calendar girl which does take place at that time is about three teen males with raging hormones wanting to meet that ultimate of calendar girls, marilyn monroe. if you remember marilyn did the ultimate calendar photos back before these kids reached puberty, but they do discover here and she kind of brings the male out in all three of them.anyway our three teens are jason priestley, jerry o&#x27;connell, and gabriel olds who decide to take a trip to hollywood to meet the girl of their wet dreams. interesting they chose marilyn, back then which was when i was that age, your typical heterosexual budding teen male fantasized more about annette funnicello than marilyn monroe. but these kids certainly had mature tastes.olds narrates the film which is seen through his character eyes and frankly when you come right down to it, it&#x27;s about stalking. of course the term hadn&#x27;t been invented yet. but now a film star of the magnitude of marilyn monroe would not be so accommodating. we&#x27;ve heard real stories about people like brad pitt and david letterman dealing with stalking fans.still it&#x27;s a harmless teenage comedy and will no doubt please the fans of the leads. 0 of 0 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
