is a disturbing but also boring movie directed by michael winterbottom. the weird amanda plummer is in the top of her career quite immediately after &#x22;pulp fiction&#x22; but the plot is too sick and repetitive. maybe in 1995 this film could be more attractive, but today it is annoying. my vote is four.title (brazil): &#x22;o beijo da borboleta&#x22;
