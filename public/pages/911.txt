user reviews &nbsp; a very lovely film... 18 may 2008 | by righty-sock (robertfrangie@hotmail.com) (mexico) &ndash; see all my reviews the film paints the story of two actors, from their first encounter at school in the twenties through their success as stars of the peking opera, difficulties during the japanese occupation, the communist takeover in 1949 and the traumas of the cultural revolution in the sixties&#133; for the so-called fifth generation of chinese filmmakers, the film touches new ground on two fronts&#133; in the first place, though it does not avoid from acknowledging the sufferings under the old regime, it takes an embittered view of communist society and of the cultural revolution specifically&#133; the two friends, xiaolou and dieyi, adopt a young man, xiao si, who becomes one of the red guards and quickly informs the political sins of his benefactors&#133; second the film is a love story of a rare kind&#133; dieyi is a homosexual and suffers rejection when xiaolou begins an affair with juxian (gong li), a gorgeous prostitute&#133; the personal conflict of each character is the heart of this exceptional movie&#133;
