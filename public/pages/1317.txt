see all my reviews the &#39;crude oasis&#39; is an odd, haunting film about a lonely woman living in one of america&#39;s oil states. throughout, the movie continually hints that a thriller, maybe even supernatural in origin, is about to explode; but contents itself with hints and resolves its issues in an understated, believable way. slightly stylised and highly atmospheric, the film proves that you don&#39;t need monsters and murderers to actually construct what is in places a seriously scary story; but it is a bit a slow in places. not a great film, it&#39;s still an interesting one: it&#39;s strange that director alex graves has made no more movies, and has hereafter worked only on television series, albeit much better known than this film. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
