trivia according to sequence director jack kinney, despite casting christian rub's role as the voice of geppetto, he was actually revealed as a nazi sympathizer who drove the animation crew crazy with his ramblings about the glories of adolf hitler. they eventually got even with him when they did the live-action shooting for the scene with geppetto fishing from inside monstro the whale. here, they had rub on a makeshift stage where he pretended to fish while the stage was jostled by some grips who "rocked the boat" to give the desired effect and effectively giving rub a ride he never forgot. see more &raquo; goofs in the pool game on pleasure island, the yellow 1-ball turns into a red 3-ball. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] jiminy cricket: [after singing "when you wish upon a star"] pretty, huh?

see more (spoiler alert!)&nbsp;&raquo; user reviews sweet and funny disney classic 2 july 2004 | by didi-5 (united kingdom) &ndash; see all my reviews 'pinocchio' benefits from one of the finest collection of songs to grace a disney cartoon; from 'i got no strings', to 'an actor's life for me', and (best of all) 'when you wish upon a star' - brilliant sung by 'ukelele ike' edwards as jiminy cricket.this cute adaptation from carlo corolli's classic novel adds pets with the 'aw' factor (cat and fish), as well as a truly scary sequence involving donkeys. the characters are all memorable and pinocchio is convincing in his move from a wooden puppet to a real boy, even in cartoon form. good voice talent from evelyn venable as the blue fairy too, especially in the bits where pinocchio can't help revealing he isn't telling the truth!short, sweet, funny, and involving, 'pinocchio' is worth an hour of anybody's time, young or old. 19 of 21 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
