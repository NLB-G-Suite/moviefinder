frequently asked questions this faq is empty. add the first question. user reviews &nbsp; flawed for sure ... but still watchable 26 august 2015 | by merklekranz (united states) &ndash; see all my reviews donald sutherland plays a news reporter who goads a sport climber into challenging a legendary mountain climber. a 3000 meter supposedly unclimbable patagonia peak is their place of destiny. &#x22;scream of stone&#x22; is an extremely uneven film, with abrupt editing and despite werner herzog directing, the whole thing really never pulls together. there is a battle of egos for most of the movie that eventually wears thin. i found the most interesting character to be &#x22;fingerless&#x22;, played by the always intriguing brad dourif. despite the spectacular mountain vistas, the film has several near fatal flaws, including some really unfunny attempts at humor, a &#x22;bimbo&#x22; who&#x27;s acting is atrocious, and an ending on the mountain that seriously lacks credibility. - merk 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 14 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo;
