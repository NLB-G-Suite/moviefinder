see all my reviews i just watched this movie on tv and my mind is reeling with the ethical dilemma it raises. i thought i'd watch it while i did the ironing but i only got a couple of items done because i was glued to the movie!i must admit also i wondered what sort of a job hugh grant would do in a role much more serious than we usually see, but...surprise! he is thoroughly convincing as a young surgeon troubled by some things that don't add up in the emergency room, troubled enough to investigate further, risking his career and ultimately his life to find out what is going on.definitely worth a look! 5 of 6 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
