(caps mine, from horrified amazement) if a labrador retriever can herd, the canine star of this movie can give birth to puppies. i&#39;m sure that the problem was that the writer didn&#39;t want to say &quot;border collie or bearded collie or australian shepherd, but why not &quot;corgi,&quot; or &quot;sheltie,&quot; or &quot;tervuren?&quot; there&#39;s an entire herding/pastoral group out there, people! a lab . . . *rolls eyes* 5 of 8 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 18 user reviews&nbsp;&raquo; getting started | contributor zone&nbsp;&raquo; contribute to this page edit page write review create a character page for: laura turner steve turner jennifer turner sam garland len collins april porter pete jarman mrs. jarman josh garland jim garland mildred garland mrs. parker customer highway patrolman #1 ----------- more... create &raquo; ? &nbsp; imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site follow imdb on home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright &copy; 1990-2017 imdb.com, inc. an amazon.com company. amazon affiliates amazon video watch movies &tv online prime video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
