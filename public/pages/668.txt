4 march 1999 | by lib-4 (florida) &ndash; see all my reviews thanks to the director who let arthur miller do the screenplay- so the movie is a honest rendition of the great play. daniel day lewis is very good- and the movie is true to the original. winona rider also does well- but joan allen is excellent. this is a true classic of american theater and since we can't always get to a live performance the movie is a good substitute... recommend every student of am. lit see it and anyone who wants to delve into the deceit of the human spirit... nothing is new people are still jealous and still vindictive and miller writes of these two traits so well. the whole cast does a credible job 13 of 15 people found this review helpful.&nbsp; was this review helpful to you?
