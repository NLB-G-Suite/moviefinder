after the book that he read while in the juvenile facility. the time line doesn't really make sense. he wouldn't have proposed the name before they entered the facility because the story didn't mean anything to them until after they were in. it wouldn't have made much sense that they talked about naming the group after they were imprisoned. see more &raquo; quotes [first lines] lorenzo: this is a true story about friendship that runs deeper than blood. this is my story and that of the only three friends in my life that truely mattered. two of them were killers who never made it past the age of 30. the other's a non-practicing attorney living with the pain of his past - too afraid to let it go, never confronting its horror. i'm the only one who can speak for them, and the children we were. see more &raquo;

see all my reviews &quot;sleepers,&quot; is a captivating, taut, ride. it's well-crafted visually and storywise, keeping my attention from the first plot point to the last, which is hard to do, as i see dozens of movies each week. i can't believe i missed this back in '96. it must have been the pedestrian title, but at any rate, the performances were top-notch and the story, both intriguing and heart-wrenching. one seemingly harmless lifting of a hot dog, places four lives in a juvenile system that rips their promise apart. wow. who cares if the story is true, the movie is entertaining and a fun ride! 50 of 71 people found this review helpful.&nbsp;
